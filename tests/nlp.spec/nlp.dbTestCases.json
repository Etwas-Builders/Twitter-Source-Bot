But Barr and Wray hit hard at the company.\n\n‚ÄúWe received effectively no help from Apple,‚Äù Wray said -- an assertion that Apple denied -- and said that the delay in accessing the phones‚Äô information means conspirators could have destroyed useful evidence.\n\nThe alleged link to al-Qaeda is also significant because it suggests the terrorist organization is still able to encourage, and possibly direct, operations in the U.S. almost two decades after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nApple said in a statement Monday it ‚Äúprovided every piece of information available,‚Äù including ‚Äúcontinuous and ongoing technical and investigative support,‚Äù while defending the need for strong encryption and saying it doesn‚Äôt have the ability to unlock password-protected devices.\n\n‚ÄúThe false claims made about our company are an excuse to weaken encryption and other security measures that protect millions of users and our national security,‚Äù the Cupertino, California-based company said. ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys, and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations.‚Äù\n\nThe Trump administration asked Apple in January for help unlocking a pair of iPhones belonging to the shooter, Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force. Alshamrani was killed by law enforcement responding to the attack.\n\nBarr previously said the shooting rampage that killed three sailors was an act of terrorism. The attack frayed U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, which removed 21 of its cadets from military training in the U.S. in response.\n\nAlshamrani and his associates in al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ‚Äúcommunicated using end-to-end encrypted apps, with warrant-proof encryption, deliberately in order to evade law enforcement,‚Äù Barr said in a statement Monday. ‚ÄúAlshamrani‚Äôs preparations for terror began years ago. He had been radicalized by 2015, and having connected and associated with AQAP operatives, joined the Royal Saudi Air Force in order to carry out a ‚Äòspecial operation.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nAfter accessing evidence on the phone, the U.S. recently carried out a counterterrorism operation targeting an overseas al-Qaeda operative that Alshamrani associated with, Barr and Wray said. However, the officials stopped short of asserting that al-Qaeda directed the Pensacola attack.\n\nShot Phone\n\nThe attorney general said that Alshamrani viewed the data on one of his iPhones as so valuable that he interrupted his rampage to fire a bullet into it.\n\nWray told lawmakers in February that the bureau had reconstructed an iPhone belonging to the shooter but still couldn‚Äôt access the encrypted data on the device.\n\nWhile the government had been pressing Apple to help it unlock the devices, experts in cybersecurity and digital forensics say the FBI has shown it has the ability to get into mobile phones when necessary without Apple‚Äôs help, as it eventually did with the one belonging to the shooter behind an attack in San Bernardino, California, five years ago.\n\n‚ÄúEvery time there‚Äôs a traumatic event requiring investigation into digital devices, the Justice Department loudly claims that it needs backdoors to encryption, and then quietly announces it actually found a way to access information without threatening the security and privacy of the entire world,‚Äù said Brett Max Kaufman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n‚ÄúThe boy who cried wolf has nothing on the agency that cried encryption,‚Äù he said in a statement.\n\n(Updates with Apple comment starting in third paragraph)\nHave a confidential tip for our reporters?\nGET IN TOUCH\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.\nLEARN MORE\nTerms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ¬©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

That update, however, didn‚Äôt go over very well with the enthusiast community, as AMD explained that only current-generation X570 and B550 motherboards would support Zen 3.\n\n\"While we wish could enable full support for every processor on every chipset, the flash memory chips that store BIOS settings and support have capacity limitations,‚Äù AMD said in a blog post. ‚ÄúGiven these limitations, and the unprecedented longevity of the AM4 socket, there will inevitably be a time and place where a transition to free up space is necessary‚Äîthe AMD 500 Series chipsets are that time.‚Äù\n\n(This is the Zen 3 compatibility chart that AMD released earlier this month)\n\nWhat a different a week makes, because AMD has now confirmed that it will extend support to both the X470 and B450 chipsets, which were introduced with the Ryzen 2000 processor family in 2018. ‚ÄúOver the past week, we closely reviewed your feedback on that news: we watched every video, read every comment and saw every Tweet,‚Äù AMD wrote today in a statement. ‚ÄúWe hear that many of you hoped for a longer upgrade path.‚Äù\n\nThis support won‚Äôt come easy due to constraints with the SPI ROM capacities of certain 400-Series motherboards, but AMD is taking a multi-step approach to ensure that those with X470 and B450 motherboards have the opportunity to take advantage of Zen 3 processors due out later this year. Those steps include:\n\nWe will develop and enable our motherboard partners with the code to support ‚ÄúZen 3‚Äù-based processors in select beta BIOSes for AMD B450 and X470 motherboards.\nThese optional BIOS updates will disable support for many existing AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ Desktop Processor models to make the necessary ROM space available.\nThe select beta BIOSes will enable a one-way upgrade path for AMD Ryzen Processors with ‚ÄúZen 3,‚Äù coming later this year. Flashing back to an older BIOS version will not be supported.\nTo reduce the potential for confusion, our intent is to offer BIOS download only to verified customers of 400 Series motherboards who have purchased a new desktop processor with ‚ÄúZen 3‚Äù inside. This will help us ensure that customers have a bootable processor on-hand after the BIOS flash, minimizing the risk a user could get caught in a no-boot situation.\nTiming and availability of the BIOS updates will vary and may not immediately coincide with the availability of the first ‚ÄúZen 3‚Äù-based processors.\nThis is the final pathway AMD can enable for 400 Series motherboards to add new CPU support. CPU releases beyond ‚ÄúZen 3‚Äù will require a newer motherboard.\nAMD continues to recommend that customers choose an AMD 500 Series motherboard for the best performance and features with our new CPUs.\n\nOf course, AMD would prefer that you use 500-Series motherboards like the X570 due to the inclusion of performance-minded optimizations and¬†support for PCIe 4.0. But for those that want a simple and effective processor upgrade path without having to buy another motherboard that would add a few hundred dollars to their bill, this is a well-deserved olive branch from AMD. It‚Äôs nice to see that AMD is listening to customer feedback, and doing its best to make good on the promise of long-term support for the AM4 socket through 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:¬† AMD, (nasdaq:amd), x470, b450, x570, zen 3, ryzen 4000, b550 Via:¬† AMD\nShow comments\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n85K\t16K\t35K\t\t\nCONVERSATIONS\nFEATURED\nFAVORITES\nYour Next Gen GPU Best Bet\n Big Navi  Ampere  Intel Xe  3dfx Voodoo 11\n\t\nMore Results\nMORE HOT HEADLINES\nSITE\n\nHome\n\nReviews\n\nNews\n\nBlogs\n\nFull Site\n\nSitemap\n\n\t\nCATEGORIES\n\nPC Components\n\nSystems\n\nMobile\n\nIT/Enterprise\n\nLeisure\n\nVideos\n\n\t\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\nAdvertise\n\nNews Tips\n\nContact\n\nHotTech Vision And Analysis\n\n\t\nMORE\n\nForums\n\nShop\n\n\t\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nYouTube\n\nFeedburner\n\nThis site is intended for informational and entertainment purposes only.

If this is just the beginning, then we're excited to see what comes next.\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 is a remake of the classic skateboarding games, and the bundle will feature all the classic modes, parks, and other features from the first two games with modern coat of paint. It's in good hands too, as it's being developed by Vicarious Visions, the same company that recreated classic games in the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy.\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 will be released for $39.99 on September 4 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. On PC, it will be an Epic Games Store exclusive. Those who pre-order will gain early access to the Warehouse demo later this summer.\n\nTHE RIGHT TEAM IS WORKING ON THE REMAKE ‚Äî Vicarious Visions is a great choice to develop this remaster. The creators of the original games, Neversoft, have since shut down, but Vicarious Visions has experience on not with different remasters but on handheld versions of older Tony Hawk games as well.\n\n\"It's obvious that they are fans of the game so when I started playing it, it felt like the same response ... yet the visuals were way over the top,\" Tony Hawk himself said in a post-reveal interview with Keighley published by the Summer Game Fest YouTube channel. Vicarious Visions has focused on recreating the originals as they were, but some helpful features like \"Revert\" from later Tony Hawk games ‚Äî allowing for more fluid trick combos ‚Äî and additional challenges are being added to make it a smoother experience.\n\n\"The number one thing for us was to get it to feel right,\" Vicarious Visions' Jen Oneal said in the same interview. \"It's got to be a high-quality game that feels like you remember it.\"\n\nAll classic modes are returning, including Multiplayer, Create a Park, and Create a Skater. These features all come with some cool improvements, like being able to play and share online.\n\nCreate a Park even lets players customize individual objects now. Skaters like Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Rune Glifberg, Kareem Campbell, Jamie Thomas and Bob Burnquist are all also returning.\n\nWHY WAS IT REMADE? \"There's been a lot of requests over the past few years,\" Hawk said. \"I could just sense it ramping up, especially as we approached the 20th anniversary of the release of the first THPS and I was talking to Activision ... and the idea was 'Why don't we remaster this?'\" Ongoing fan demand made it clear to both Tony Hawk and Activision that this was a project that needed to happen.\n\n\"1 and 2 is the jumping-off point,\" Hawk said, implying that this is just the beginning. \"I would love to be able to do more down the line. I think that we can make this stuff look spectacular.\" If the fan response is any indication, that will end up happening. The replies to the announcement are filled with positivity, with some fans even going as far as to demand that EA now revive the Skate series with Skate 4 as well.\n\nTHE INVERSE ANALYSIS ‚Äî Given the popularity of the skateboarding series, the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remaster is an excellent reveal for Geoff Keighley to kick off Summer Game Fest with. It's a remake of a highly beloved game and will hopefully get a series that lost its way back on track, and it's potent enough that anyone who may have been skeptical of Summer Game Fest as a concept can now expect more exciting announcements just like this.\n\nVicarious Visions is a nice match for the project too, and the early look we've gotten at the game seems promising for long-time fans and newcomers alike. If Geoff Keighley can keep up this level of momentum, then we'll have a lot to look forward to with the rest of his Summer Game Fest in the coming months.\n\nTONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER 1 AND 2 WILL BE RELEASED FOR PC VIA EPIC GAME STORE, PS4, AND XBOX ONE ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2020.\n\nRELATED TAGS\nVIDEO GAMESSPORTS\nShare:\nSCIENCE\nINNOVATION\nENTERTAINMENT\nMIND AND BODY\nGAMING\nCULTURE\nNEWSLETTERS\nSMALL BUSINESS\nABOUT\nNEWSLETTER\nTERMS\nTOPICS\nPRIVACY\nARCHIVE\nDMCA\nBROWSE\nADVERTISE\nETHICS\nCONTACT\nINVERSE ¬© 2020 Bustle Digital Group"},"_id":"5ec451c110ead823fd4d94be","id":"tonyHawkProSakter","tweetId":"1262435338980675584","type":"Good","tweetContent":"Activision said Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2 wont have Microtransactions at launch but they might add them later.\n\nClassic Activision.

Wednesday's post-market earnings release may yield the next step of this advance, with quarterly results likely to meet modest expectations. Consensus estimates now expect the company to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05 on fourth quarter revenues of $3.21 billion.\n\nThe chip giant sold off more than 9% in October after missing third quarter revenues and lowering fourth quarter guidance. Consensus estimates have drifted to the high end of expectations in the past three months, driven by the phase one trade deal and better-than-expected chip prices. Broad sector indices have exploded to new highs at the same time, generating a stiff tailwind for components at all capitalization levels.\n\nWall Street has been ignoring Texas Instruments stock in recent months, issuing few upgrades or downgrades despite broad sector strength. Committed buyers have picked up the slack during this period, generating a recovery wave that has now reached the July 2019 high near $130. More importantly, a two-year basing pattern on top of the historic April 2000 top looks nearly complete, setting the stage for a period of more consistent upside.\n\nTXN Long-Term Chart (1991 ‚Äì 2020)\nTradingView.com\n\nA multi-year downtrend ended at a split-adjusted $1.41 in 1991, giving way to a powerful trend advance that unfolded in multiple waves into the 2000 high at $100.00. The stock got crushed with the broad tech universe when the internet bubble burst, dropping more than 85% into the October 2002 low at $12.10. A two-legged recovery topped out at the 2002 swing high in the $30s in 2004, yielding several failed tests, followed by a 2007 breakout.\n\nThe subsequent reversal failed the breakout, generating a volatile decline that found support within 30 cents of the 2002 low after the 2008 economic collapse. A bounce into 2013 completed a double bottom reversal, establishing the strongest uptrend so far this century. The stock posted exceptionally strong gains into the fourth quarter of 2017, completing a round trip into the 2000 high.\n\nThe rally stalled at $120 in January 2018, giving way to sideways action, followed by a fourth quarter decline that ended at a 14-month low in the upper $80s in December. The stock recouped 100% of those losses into April 2019 and broke out once again in July but has made little or no progress in the past six months, stuck in a rectangular range between $115 and $135.¬†Given this positioning, a buy-the-news reaction this week might clear that range and finally confirm the breakout above multi-decade resistance.\n\nThe monthly stochastics oscillator entered a sell cycle from the overbought zone in September and is now crossing into a bull cycle. This type of mixed action often generates false signals, adding risk to long positions taken in reaction to the news. In addition, price action since 2017 has carved a rising wedge pattern, which has a relatively high correlation with failed breakouts. Even so, these red flags aren't sufficient to keep new investors on the sidelines.\n\nTXN Short-Term Chart (2017 ‚Äì 2020)\nTradingView.com\n\nThe on-balance volume (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator topped out in June 2018, about six months after the price peak, entering a distribution phase that ended in October. Subsequent buying power reached the prior high in May 2019, but OBV has just whipsawed across the resistance line in the past nine months. This indicates a persistent standoff between bulls and bears, even though price has drifted up to range resistance.\n\nWedge resistance has lifted to $135, or about three points above Friday's closing print. This warns market players to avoid buying a breakout in reaction to this week's report until it clears this formidable barrier. More conservative players may also wish to wait until OBV mounts the red line, which would lift accumulation readings to all-time highs. Once those technical elements are in place, shareholders can look forward to a bull rush and more vertical rally trajectory.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTexas Instruments needs to clear a final resistance barrier at $135 to confirm a historic breakout that opens the door to outsized gains.\n\nDisclosure: The author held no positions in the aforementioned securities at the time of publication.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS BASIC EDUCATION\n\nTackling Technicals for Beginners\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS BASIC EDUCATION\n\nIntroduction to Technical Analysis Price Patterns\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS BASIC EDUCATION\n\nThe Anatomy of Trading Breakouts\n\nFUTURES & COMMODITIES TRADING\n\nAnalyzing The 5 Most Liquid Commodity Futures\n\nECONOMICS\n\nA Brief History of Bear Markets\n\nTOP STOCKS\n\nThe World's Top 10 Semiconductor Companies\nPartner Links\nRelated Terms\nCup and Handle\nA cup and handle is a bullish technical price pattern that appears in the shape of a handled cup on a price chart. more\nBear Market Definition\nA bear market occurs when prices in the market fall by 20% or more. more\nCBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Definition\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, is an index created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which shows the market's expectation of 30-day volatility. more\nWhat Was the Great Depression?\nThe Great Depression was a devastating and prolonged economic recession that had several contributing factors.

CBD isn‚Äôt psychoactive, unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the other byproduct of cannabis.\n\nCBD is thought to activate serotonin receptors. It plays a role in:\n\npain perception\nmaintaining body temperature\nreducing inflammation\n\nAccording to recent studies, CBD also:\n\nhelps ease symptoms of depression\ncan possibly prevent symptoms of psychosis\n\nThese benefits are what make CBD an appealing alternative treatment for pain disorders such as fibromyalgia.\n\nResearch on CBD for fibromyalgia\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes musculoskeletal pain in addition to:\n\nfatigue\ninsomnia\ncognitive issues\n\nIt mostly affects women, and currently there‚Äôs no known cure for the condition. However, treatment options are available that focus on pain management.\n\nCBD has been used to ease chronic pain symptoms and reduce inflammation. It‚Äôs presented as an alternative to taking opioid prescriptions which can be addictive.\n\nHowever, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn‚Äôt approved CBD as a treatment option for fibromyalgia or most other conditions. The CBD-based prescription drug Epidiolex, an epilepsy treatment, is the only CBD product that‚Äôs FDA-approved and regulated.\n\nThere are currently no published studies on fibromyalgia that look at the effects of CBD on its own. However, some research does look at the effects of cannabis, which may contain multiple cannabinoids, on fibromyalgia.\n\nThe results have been mixed. More human studies are needed.\n\nEarlier studies\n\nA 2009 review found that CBD can be used to relieve neuropathic pain. The researchers concluded that cannabinoids such as CBD might be a useful adjunct to other pain medications.\n\nA 2011 study looked at 56 people with fibromyalgia. Most of the participants were women.\n\nMembers of the study comprised two groups:\n\nOne group was comprised of 28 study participants who weren‚Äôt cannabis users.\nThe second group was comprised of 28 study participants who were cannabis users. The frequency of their cannabis use, or the amount of cannabis they used, varied.\n\nTwo hours after using cannabis, the cannabis users experienced benefits such as:\n\nreduced pain and stiffness\nan increase in sleepiness\n\nThey also had slightly higher mental health scores than the non-users.\n\n2019 Dutch study\n\nA 2019 Dutch study looked at the effect of cannabis on 20 women with fibromyalgia. Over the course of the study, each participant received four types of cannabis:\n\nan unspecified amount of a placebo variety, which contained no CBD or THC\n200 milligrams (mg) of a variety with high amounts of both CBD and THC (Bediol)\n200 mg of a variety with high amounts of CBD and low amounts of THC (Bedrolite)\n100 mg of a variety with low amounts of CBD and high amounts of THC (Bedrocan)\n\nThe researchers found that the spontaneous pain scores of people using the placebo variety were similar to the spontaneous pain scores of people using some of the non-placebo varieties.\n\nHowever, Bediol, which is high in CBD and THC, brought relief to a greater number of people than the placebo did. It caused a 30 percent reduction of spontaneous pain in 18 of the 20 participants. The placebo caused a 30 percent reduction of spontaneous pain in 11 participants.\n\nUse of Bediol or Bedrocan, both high-THC varieties, significantly improved pressure pain thresholds when compared to the placebo.\n\nBedrolite, which is high in CBD and low in THC, didn‚Äôt show any evidence of being able to relieve spontaneous or evoked pain.\n\n2019 Israeli study\n\nIn a 2019 Israeli study, hundreds of people with fibromyalgia were observed over a period of at least 6 months. Of the participants, 82 percent were women.\n\nThe study participants received guidance from nurses before taking medical cannabis. The nurses provided advice on:\n\nthe 14 cannabis strains that were available\ndelivery methods\ndosages\n\nAll the participants started with a low dosage of cannabis, and dosages were increased gradually over the course of the study. The median approved dosage of cannabis started at 670 mg a day.\n\nAt 6 months, the median approved dosage of cannabis was 1,000 mg a day. The median approved dosage of THC was 140 mg, and the median approved dosage of CBD was 39 mg a day.\n\nThe researchers admitted that the study had limitations. For instance, they were only able to follow up with about 70 percent of participants. The use of so many different strains also made it difficult to compare the effects of CBD-rich and THC-rich strains.\n\nHowever, they still concluded that medical cannabis was a safe and effective treatment for fibromyalgia.\n\nAt the beginning of the study, 52.5 percent of participants, or 193 people, described their pain level as high. At the 6-month follow-up, only 7.9 percent of those who responded, or 19 people, reported high levels of pain.\n\nCBD treatment options\n\nIf you want to avoid the psychoactive effects of marijuana, you can find CBD products that contain only trace amounts of THC. If you live in a place where recreational or medical marijuana is legal, you can find CBD products that contain higher concentrations of THC.\n\nAlthough they each have benefits separately, CBD and TCH likely work best when combined. Experts refer to this synergy, or interaction, as the ‚Äúentourage effect.‚Äù\n\nCBD also acts against THC-targeted receptors to reduce the negative effects of marijuana, such as paranoia and anxiety.\n\nYou can consume CBD in a number of ways, including:\n\nSmoking or vaping. If you want to relieve immediate pain, smoking CBD-rich cannabis is the quickest way to reduce symptoms. Effects can last up to 3 hours. Smoking or vaping allows you to directly inhale CBD from the cannabis plant, absorbing the chemical into your bloodstream and lungs.\nEdibles. Edibles are foods cooked with the cannabis plant, or cannabis-infused oil or butter. It‚Äôll take longer to experience symptom relief, but the effects of edibles can last for up to 6 hours.\nOil extracts. Oils can be applied topically, taken orally, or dissolved under the tongue and absorbed in mouth tissues.\nTopicals. CBD oils can be infused into topical creams or balms and applied directly to the skin. These CBD products can be an effective option for reducing inflammation and helping with external pain.\n\nThere may be respiratory risks to smoking or vaping marijuana. People with asthma or lung conditions shouldn‚Äôt use this method.\n\nYou should also follow dosage instructions carefully, especially with edibles, to avoid the negative side effects of taking too much.\n\nCBD side effects\n\nCannabidiol is thought to be safe and to have minimal side effects. However, some people have experienced the following side effects after using CBD:\n\nfatigue\ndiarrhea\nappetite changes\nweight changes\n\nA study on mice linked CBD intake to liver toxicity. However, some of the mice in that study had been force-fed large amounts of CBD in the form of CBD-rich cannabis extract.\n\nDrug interactions are possible with CBD. Be aware of them if you‚Äôre currently taking other supplements or medications.\n\nCBD, like grapefruit, also interferes with cytochromes P450 (CYPs). This group of enzymes is important to drug metabolism.\n\nOutlook\n\nResearchers are still exploring whether CBD can effectively treat chronic pain disorders. Further studies are needed. There are some success stories, but CBD isn‚Äôt FDA-approved for fibromyalgia. Also, research has yet to show us the long-term effects of CBD on the body.\n\nUntil more is known, traditional fibromyalgia treatment is recommended.\n\nIf you decide to use CBD products for pain management, be sure to consult with a doctor first. They can help you avoid negative side effects or harmful interactions with your current medications and treatments.\n\nIs CBD Legal? Hemp-derived CBD products (with less than 0.3 percent THC) are legal on the federal level, but are still illegal under some state laws. Marijuana-derived CBD products are illegal on the federal level, but are legal under some state laws. Check your state‚Äôs laws and those of anywhere you travel. Keep in mind that nonprescription CBD products are not FDA-approved, and may be inaccurately labeled.\nREAD THIS NEXT\nTop 10 CBD Gummies\nMedically reviewed by Alan Carter, Pharm.D.\n\nLooking for the best CBD gummies?

If you're an athlete, casual gym-goer, or just want to lose a few pounds, protein also helps you build and retain muscle. Taking whey protein is an effective and inexpensive way to add more of the macronutrient to your diet.¬†\n\nIn short, whey is the liquid leftovers that come from the cheese-making process. This liquid is dried into a powder, which is then mixed with sweeteners while keeping calories, carbohydrates, and fats to a minimum.\n\nBefore we get into our picks of the best whey protein powders, let's first cover why it's a solid part of anyone's diet and how it should be consumed.¬†\n\nWhat is whey protein, why it's beneficial, and how should you use it?\n\nThere are three main types of whey protein:\n\nWhey protein concentrate (WPC): This is a concentrated protein that keeps more of the nutrients. Most non-isolate proteins are comprised of WPC.\nWhey protein isolate (WPI): This is similar to WPC but most of the carbohydrates, fat, and fat-soluble vitamins have been removed, so the powder has a higher percentage of protein. Typically, isolate is digested more quickly and, therefore, more agreeable for some. For that reason, most trainers and registered dieticians recommend opting for WPI, though it's often more expensive.\nWhey protein hydrolysate (WPH): WPH is considered pre-digested since it breaks down peptides ‚Äî the building blocks of proteins ‚Äî to help with quicker absorption.\n\nIn addition to our research and experience in testing whey protein products, we consulted two experts for this guide: Jeb Stuart Johnston, the head strength coach at Brooklyn Strong and a nutrition coach at Stronger U, and Maryann Walsh, a registered dietician and the owner of Walsh Nutrition.\n\nHow much should you consume?¬†\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein consumption is about a gram for every 3 pounds of body weight. So, if you weigh 180 pounds, that equates to 60 grams of protein per day. Experts suggest that taking up to twice that still produces benefits.\n\nWhen it comes to fitness-specific goals, like gaining muscle or losing fat, Johnston recommends ingesting up to one gram per pound of bodyweight. His claim is backed up via a study by the University of Stirling.¬†\n\n\"For someone who's trying to gain muscle mass and work out, taking in more protein helps speed up protein synthesis [the process in which your muscle fibers utilize protein to repair and grow],\" Johnston said. \"For a person who's strictly trying to lose weight, taking in more protein helps retain the muscle you already have.\"¬†\n\nBased on Johnston's recommendations, a 200-pound man would have to consume 200 grams of protein per day. That's equivalent to 2 pounds of chicken breast. Supplementing with whey protein, he explains, is a convenient way to get more protein without grilling up another piece of bland chicken.\n\nAbout our expertise\n\nThe co-author, Andrew Gutman, is a former associate editor at Muscle & Fitness magazine, has competed in a bodybuilding show and two Strongman competitions, and has been lifting weights regularly for over a decade. He's tried dozens of different whey protein powders.\n\nOur guide features powders that have a taste you can stomach, a high protein content, and minimal fat, carbs, and calories. Guides Editor, Les Shu, is a former research chief at Men's Fitness who oversaw the fact-checking of the magazine's nutrition and exercise articles.\n\nHere are the best whey protein powders you can buy:\nBest whey protein powder overall: Cellucor Whey Protein Isolate & Concentrate Blend Powder\nBest sugar-free whey protein powder: Optimum Nutrition Platinum Hydrowhey\nBest-tasting whey protein powder: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder\nBest fat-free whey protein powder: Myprotein Impact Whey Isolate Protein\nBest digestion-friendly whey protein powder: Dymatize ISO 100 Whey Protein Powder\n\nUpdated on 4/27/2020 by Rick Stella: Updated the introduction to include more on the benefits of protein, how much people should take, and the different types of whey, checked each pick for availability, and updated the prices, links, and formatting.¬†\n\n\nIs whey protein consumption safe?\nSyda Productions/Shutterstock\n\nBefore you increase your protein intake significantly, check with your health-care professional since people with certain maladies, such as calcium deficiencies or low blood pressure, could experience adverse effects from whey protein.¬†\n\nIt's also important to note that protein powders aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some companies dilute their protein with useless fillers, which is why certain brands subject themselves to third-party testing as a way to verify the quality of their product.\n\nTo know if a protein is tested, look for a seal from either NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Choice. This doesn't mean that untested proteins are a subpar product but it's good to be aware. You are, after all, putting this stuff into your body. Other than looking for brands that are third-party tested, here are different ways to spot a quality protein:\n\nEnsure that protein is the first ingredient on the label. \"When you look at a label, it's in descending order so the ingredient in the highest amount will be found at the top of the list,\" Walsh told Business Insider. \"Look for labels that have protein at the beginning with fewer ingredients accompanying them.\"\nTypically, you want a whey powder that contains at least 20 grams of protein per serving. All of our picks do.\nTry to steer clear of excess sugar. As for artificial sweeteners, research on how they affect our weight and health is mixed.\nThe best overall whey protein powder\nAmazon\nIf you're looking for a powder that mixes easily and tastes great, Cellucor Whey Protein Isolate & Concentrate Blend Powder is one of the best and most affordable options.\n\nThe Cellucor Whey Protein Isolate & Concentrate Blend Powder not only tastes good and has 24 grams of protein per serving, but it's also the most affordable option in our guide at 71.4 cents per serving and 3 cents per gram of protein. Each serving also only has 1.5 grams of fat, 4 grams of carbs, and 120 calories.\n\nThere are seven flavors to choose from, including whipped vanilla, molten chocolate, and cinnamon swirl. Cellucor recommends mixing two scoops with five to six ounces of your preferred beverage, but you can adjust the amount of liquid to fit your tastes. The company also suggests mixing the powder with yogurt, oatmeal, and pancakes. ‚Äî James Brains, reviewed by Andrew Gutman\n\nPros: Great taste, affordable, mixes smoothly, 24 grams of protein per serving, excellent for baking, third-party tested\n\nCons: 130 mg of sodium per serving, contains artificial sweeteners\n\n$49.99 FROM AMAZON\n$55.55 FROM WALMART\nThe best sugar-free whey protein powder\nAmazon\nThe Platinum Hydrowhey by Optimum Nutrition may be expensive, but it mixes well and boasts 30 grams of protein per serving with zero grams of sugar.\n\nA single serving of¬†Optimum Nutrition's Platinum Hydrowhey yields 140 calories, 30 grams of protein, one gram of fat, 3 grams of carbs, and no sugar. It's made of hydrolyzed whey protein, which breaks down the protein into smaller pieces for better absorption and easier digestion.¬†\n\nYou can choose from seven flavors: cookies and cream overdrive, chocolate mint, velocity vanilla, chocolate peanut butter, supercharged strawberry, turbo chocolate, and red velvet cake, which was the highest-rated flavor on Bodybuilding.com. I think that turbo chocolate tastes great, too.\n\nThere is no sugar in this product but Optimum Nutrition does use artificial sweeteners such as sucralose and high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nOptimum Nutrition claims you can easily mix this protein with just a spoon and I can confirm this is true. While this may not seem like a strong selling point, I've forgotten my shaker bottle at home many times and have had to mix my protein with a spoon or knife at work. When I tried this with other brands, I always got clumpy, gross-tasting shakes. ‚Äî Andrew Gutman\n\nPros: 30 grams of protein per serving, third-party tested, superb mixability, no sugar\n\nCons: Contains high-fructose corn syrup\n\n$54.89 FROM AMAZON\n$56.58 FROM WALMART\nThe best-tasting whey protein powder\nAmazon\nThe Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder packs 24 grams of protein into each serving and is one of the better-tasting powders according to experts and buyers.\n\nThe Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder gets its sweetness from a little bit of sugar (1 gram per serving) and acesulfame potassium, which is an artificial sweetener also known as Ace-K.\n\nEach serving has 120 calories, a gram of fat, three grams of carbs, and most importantly 24 grams of protein. Optimum Nutrition has also curated a number of recipes in which you can use the powder. ‚Äî James Brains, reviewed by Andrew Gutman\n\nPros: Tastes good, relatively affordable, safe ingredients, third-party tested\n\nCons: Complaints about the formula changing, contains an artificial sweetener\n\n$59.99 FROM AMAZON\n$59.99 FROM GNC\nThe best fat-free whey protein powder\nAmazon\nThe Myprotein Impact Whey Isolate Protein is a great option if you want as much protein packed into each scoop as possible without extra fat, carbs, or calories.\n\nDepending on the flavor you choose, the Myprotein Impact Whey Isolate Protein fits up to 22 grams of protein into each 25-gram serving.\n\nIt does this with little or no fat or sugar and only 90 calories per serving. The sodium content is also low at 25 mg per serving.¬†\n\nLabdoor independently tests dozens of whey protein powders, and the site recommended the Myprotein Impact Whey Isolate because it scored high in Labdoor's ingredient safety, nutritional value, and product purity tests. The testers found there were 21.9 grams of protein in every 25-gram serving.\n\nThere are a few complaints worth mentioning, too. Make sure you buy the whey isolate and not just the whey concentrate (If you follow our links, you should be fine). ‚Äî James Brains, reviewed by Andrew Gutman\n\nPros: Safe ingredients, excellent product purity, a high concentration of bound protein, fat-free, low in sodium\n\nCons: Concerns about quality control, contains artificial sweetener, not third-party tested\n\n$28.32 FROM AMAZON\n$39.99 FROM MYPROTEIN\nThe best digestion-friendly powder\nAmazon\nIf you've found protein powders leave your stomach feeling queasy, consider the lactose-free Dymatize ISO 100 Whey Protein Powder.\n\nThe Dymatize ISO 100 Whey Protein Powder is the only lactose-free option on our list but it's not the only one that uses hydrolyzed isolate protein‚Äîthe Optimum Nutrition Platinum Hydrowhey does, too‚Äîwhich is supposed to help with digestion and absorption.\n\nEach serving has 25 grams of protein, less than a gram of fat, 120 calories, and 2 grams of carbs, including less than 1 gram of sugar. There are 13 flavors to choose from, including cinnamon bun, fudge brownie, gourmet chocolate, and chocolate coconut.¬†\n\nLabdoor recommends the Dymatize ISO 100 as one of the best whey protein powders. In its tests, the powder had high scores for nutritional value and product purity, including less than one part per million of six harmful substances. Around 91% of the calories in this powder come from its protein content. ‚Äî James Brains, reviewed by Andrew Gutman\n\nPros: Lactose-free, 91% of calories are from protein, less than a gram of sugar and fat, third-party tested\n\nCons: Complaints of foreign objects found in the powder, contains an artificial sweetener, 160 mg sodium per serving\n\n$66.84 FROM AMAZON\n$29.99 FROM GNC\nWhat else we considered\nAmazon\n\nAnimal Whey: I like Animal because the company doesn't make gimmicky claims or rely on pseudoscience to sell its products. What you see is what you get and what you get is 120 calories, one gram of fat, 2 grams of carbs, and 25 grams of protein per serving. Animal uses whey protein isolate as its primary protein source, it's moderately priced,¬†and¬†it's third-party tested.\n\nThis wasn't included, however, because it's no better than any other pick. Compared to Optimum Nutrition or Dymatize or Cellucor, it's slightly more expensive and isn't as lauded by fans. It barely missed the cut.¬†\n\nPro Jym Protein Powder: A fan favorite, Pro Jym is comprised of four different proteins: whey protein isolate, micellar casein, egg albumin, and milk protein isolate. According creator, Dr. Jim Stoppani, Ph.D., this extends the rate of digestion for better protein synthesis. It comes in three flavors: chocolate cookie crunch, cookies and cream, and s'mores, and contains 150 calories, 3 grams of fat, 7 grams of carbs, and 24 grams of protein per serving.¬†\n\nPro Jym missed the mark for two reasons:\n\nYou pay more for three times the amount of fat and carbs as Optimum Nutrition's Platinum Hydrowhey, so it doesn't fit into our minimum fillers criteria.\nIt's not a pure whey protein powder.¬†\n\nPerformix ioWhey: I personally like this protein powder because it tastes great (my favorite flavor is fruity cereal), it's easy on the stomach, and there are minimal extras. One serving of Performix ioWhey is 100 calories, zero grams of fat, 2 grams of carbohydrates, and 22 grams of protein.¬†\n\nMy major issue is that Performix claims ioWhey is absorbed 36% more efficiently than other brands, which is why their protein per serving is low. That sounds great but since the product isn't third-party tested, there's no way to know if this is true or if the company's selling you less protein per serving. For the price per serving, you're better off buying Optimum Nutrition or Dymatize ISO 100 if you're willing to shell out for a premium protein. ‚Äî Andrew Gutman\n\nWhere to buy whey protein?\nShutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to buying protein, one convenient ordering option is Amazon's \"Subscribe & Save\" program, since it can save you up to 15%. You're able to cancel your subscription at any time, too. What's great about this program is that it automates ordering products that you replenish regularly.\n\nFor instance, if you take a serving of protein powder every day and there are 30 servings in a container, you can have a new tub delivered every month without lifting a finger.\n\nPersonally, I like to buy my protein from Bodybuilding.com. I usually try a different brand of protein each time I order more, so Amazon's \"Subscribe & Save\" program doesn't make sense for me, although it's a smart option for many people. Bodybuilding.com has reliable customer reviews and it routinely offers deals on popular brands. As a bonus, it offers free shipping on orders over $75.\n\nTo figure out the cost per serving on your own, take the product's price and divide it by the number of servings in the container. Since the amount of protein per serving varies by brand, it's also useful to look at the cost per gram of protein. This is easy to calculate by dividing the cost per serving (as calculated above) by the number of grams of protein per serving. ‚Äî Andrew Gutman\n\nHealthcare Explained:\n\nTelehealth Industry\nValue-Based Care\nSenior Care & Assisted Living Market\nMedical Devices & Wearable Tech\nAI in Healthcare\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nAI in Medical Diagnosis\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter.\n\n\n\nYou can purchase syndication rights to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by the Insider Reviews team.

Siraj Wahhaj, who shares a name with his son who was arrested Saturday, testified as a character witness for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the notorious \"blind sheikh\" who was convicted in 1995 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to the younger Siraj Wahhaj, authorities found 11 children and four adults living in \"filthy\" conditions at the compound Saturday in Amalia, New Mexico. Prosecutors also alleged in court documents that Wahhaj, 39, was teaching the children to commit school shootings. The documents claim Wahhaj was conducting weapons training with assault rifles at the compound with the children.\n\nMan at filthy New Mexico compound was training kids to commit school shootings, prosecutors say\n\n\nTaos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe previously said adults at the compound were \"considered extremist of the Muslim belief.\" He did not elaborate, saying it was part of the investigation.\n\nThis Friday, Aug. 3, 2018, photo released by Taos County Sheriff's Office shows Siraj Wahhaj.¬†\nTAOS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE VIA AP\n\nThe elder Wahhaj heads Masjid At-Taqwa mosque in Brooklyn, New York, which has attracted speakers over the years who have been described as radical.¬†\n\nTrending News\nWhere's my stimulus check?

He is accused of kidnapping the boy.\n\nPolice said Tuesday they had found human remains¬†on a remote part of the compound, but officials are waiting for positive identification. Wahhaj and the other adults on the compound have been charged with child abuse.\n\nProsecutor Timothy Hasson filed the court documents while asking that Wahhaj be held without bail. ¬†\n\n\"He poses a great danger to the children found on the property as well as a threat to the community as a whole due to the presence of firearms and his intent to use these firearms in a violent and illegal manner,\" Hasson wrote. ¬†\n\nA judge ordered all five adults be held without bond.¬†\n\nIn a Georgia arrest warrant, authorities said Wahhaj had told his son's mother that he wanted to perform an exorcism on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil. He later said he was taking the child to a park and didn't return.\n\nThis Friday, August 3, 2018, image shows a rural compound during an unsuccessful search for a missing 3-year-old boy in Amalia, New Mexico.\nTAOS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE VIA AP\n\nThe arrest warrant issued there says the missing boy has a condition caused by lack of oxygen and blood flow around the time of birth. He cannot walk and requires constant attention, his mother told police.\n\nFor months, neighbors worried about the squalid compound built along a remote New Mexico plain, saying they took their concerns to authorities long before sheriff's officials raided the facility described as a small camping trailer in the ground.\n\nThe search at the compound came amid a two-month investigation that included the FBI. Hogrefe said federal agents surveilled the area a few weeks ago but did not find probable cause to search the property.\n\nThat changed when Georgia detectives forwarded a message to the sheriff that he said initially had been sent to a third party, saying: \"We are starving and need food and water.\"\n\nAuthorities found what Hogrefe called \"the saddest living conditions and poverty\" he has seen in 30 years in law enforcement. He said Wahhaj was armed with multiple firearms, including an assault rifle.

Spotify essentially created the market as it exists today and has millions more users globally than any other service, but Apple Music is catching up, thanks to its deep integration in Apple's popular iOS ecosystem.\n\n\nBoth Spotify and ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå offer as much music and related content as your ears could handle ‚Äì including exclusive new releases from top artists ‚Äì and all of it can be streamed ad-free (with Spotify's paid tier) or downloaded for offline play. So which is the best option for you? Keep reading as we pit the two services against each other.\n\nSubscriptions and Price Plans Similar\n\nAn individual ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå subscription costs $9.99 per month in the United States, with slight price variations in other countries and territories. Likewise, an individual Spotify subscription or \"Premium\" plan costs $9.99 per month, with some regional variations. In addition to its paid plan, Spotify also offers a free ad-supported service that allows users to shuffle-play songs, although premium features remain off limits.\n\n\nBoth services offer student and family plans for $4.99 per month and $14.99 per month, respectively. Spotify's student offering currently includes additional access to an ad-supported Hulu TV plan and unlimited access to the SHOWTIME streaming service. ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå and Spotify family plans meanwhile are very similar. Up to six people can access the services using a personal account for each family member, with the exception that ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå members can also share iTunes purchases in addition to catalog content. ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå does, however, require all family members to use the same credit card for App Store purchases.\n\n\nBoth ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå and Spotify memberships automatically renew each month, but you can cancel renewal at any time and your subscription will run out at the end of your current billing cycle. A canceled Spotify premium subscription reverts your account to the free, ad-supported service at the end of the current billing cycle. (Related: How to cancel an Apple Music subscription)\n\nFree Trials Compared\n\n‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå offers a free three-month trial of its paid service, which converts to a paid membership unless the user cancels before the trial period is over.\n\nTry Apple Music free for 3 months\n\nSpotify also offers a free trial of its Premium plan, but it only lasts for 30 days before billing begins, although you do have the option to use the free plan for as long as you want if you need more time to make up your mind about the service.\n\nLibraries and Offline Listening\n\nAll paid ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå and Spotify plans give you access to a huge catalog of songs when you sign up. ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå boasts 50 million songs in its catalog, while Spotify subscribers have the pick of \"over 35 million\" songs, so regardless of which one has the most content, both allow you to build up a large collection of music.\n\n\nHowever when it comes to offline listening, there are limits. ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå users can download a maximum of 100,000 songs to their library, and using Apple's iCloud Music Library feature these can be synced across devices signed into the same Apple ID. Spotify Premium members can download up to 10,000 songs on each of up to 5 different devices, but this number doesn't include saved playlists.\n\nOffline listening on the services covers songs, video content, concerts and artist exclusives. In addition, Spotify subscribers have access to audiobooks and podcasts, and the company is known to be investing heavily in its podcasts offering, so users can expect a lot more content in this department soon.\n\nStreaming quality Differences\n\n‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå streams 256kbps AAC files, while Spotify uses the Ogg Vorbis format and lets you choose the bitrate depending on how you're listening. On mobile you can elect to stream in Low (24 kbit/s), Normal (96 kbit/s), High (160 kbit/s) or Very High (320 kbit/s) quality.\n\nApart from audiophiles, most listeners probably won't notice much difference between the highest-quality Spotify and ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå streams of the same song, but Spotify's ability to select the bitrate can come in handy if you're worried about using up your cellular data.\n\nMobile, Desktop, and Web Apps\n\nThe ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå catalog is accessed within the Music app, which has a clean white interface and comes pre-installed on every iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, and is available as a separate downloadable app on Android devices. Spotify's apps have a contrasting uniform black interface and are also available on both iOS and Android.\n\n\nThe ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå mobile app is organized into tabs to access your music library, browse the ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå catalog, and listen to radio stations, while a \"For You\" tab lets you check out suggestions based on your listening preferences. The Spotify mobile app has a similar tabbed format, giving you access to listening recommendations, a catalog search function, and your library.\n\nBoth apps are easy to navigate and include fullscreen media players that showcase album art as you listen. These screens also put add-to-playlist, sharing, song queuing, and audio device options at your fingertips, with ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå having the advantage of 3D Touch support on compatible devices, allowing you to quickly access additional menus.\n\n\nUnlike Apple's Music app, one notable limitation of the Spotify app for iOS is that you can't merge local music stored on your device with your Spotify library -- you have to use the Local files feature in the desktop app to sync them across from your computer, and unfortunately it doesn't work as well as Apple's ‚ÄåiCloud‚Äå Music Library feature.\n\nOn desktop, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå subscribers can access the service through the iTunes app for Mac and PC. ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå in iTunes is largely based on the same format as the mobile app, but it's not quite as pretty. It's also a little less navigable, but it does have one trick up its sleeve: Smart Playlists. These can be automatically generated by iTunes based on genre, date added, loved/disliked, and so on, meaning you don't have to manually build playlists yourself if you don't want to.\n\nSpotify also offers apps for Mac and PC. They recreate the mobile interface for desktop well, and are slimmer and easier to navigate than iTunes, which feels bloated in comparison.\n\nIn addition, Spotify offers a handy web player for accessing the service from any web browser, which is convenient if you want to access the service on a computer that doesn't have the Spotify app installed (your office PC, for example). ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå still lacks an equivalent, but subscribers can use a free third-party web player called Musish, although it's currently in development and still missing a few features.\n\nDiscovery Feature Differences\n\nWhen you sign up for ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå, Apple asks you to select some of your favorite artists so that the service can get a sense of your tastes. Using this information, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå populates its regularly updated For You section with new releases, daily mixes and playlists to appeal to your preferences. Playlists can take on a style (pop or jazz, for example), a particular artist, or even a particular activity like studying.\n\nComparatively, Spotify's Home screen is where the service's personalization is centered. Discover Weekly is added every Monday morning, and delivers a two-hour playlist of personalized music recommendations based on your listening habits, as well as the habits of other users who listen to similar artists. Meanwhile, Daily Mixes playlists feature tracks and artists in a certain genre that you've been listening to, plus a few additional recommendations, while Release Radar is a playlist of new releases recommended just for you.\n\n\nWhile Spotify's Home screen also features new releases and \"Made for Everyone\" playlists categorized into genres and moods, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå's non-personalized content lives in a separate Browse tab showcasing trending artists and playlists, top charts, and music videos. Browse is also home to a TV and films section that features Apple-made programming like \"Carpool Karaoke\" and artist documentaries.\n\n‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå's Radio tab features curated music stations tuned to your listening habits as well as Apple's Beats 1 radio station. Beats 1 offers live radio 24 hours a day, and also plays a big part in the platform's music discovery. The Radio tab also has an archive of its most popular radio shows and playlists from years past.\n\nSpotify doesn't really have an equivalent, although when you create a station from a song, album, artist, or playlist, Spotify Radio creates picks the music for you, and while ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå has the same feature, Spotify's suggestion algorithm is generally much better. On the flip side, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå's Search tab includes the option to search the ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå catalog using a lyric phrase, which is really handy when you don't know or can't remember the name of a song.\n\nMusic Sharing\n\nBoth services allow you to follow friends who are also subscribers and share playlists with them that you've personally created. Spotify and ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå also let you share song links via text or over social media. In the Spotify desktop app you can see what song your friends are currently listening to, provided they choose to share this information. Similarly, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå's For You tab shows what your friends are listening to if you've connected to them.\n\nSpeakers and Voice Assistants Compatibility\n\nAs an ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå subscriber, you can use Siri as a personal DJ to control song playback, queue up songs, find song facts, add songs to your library, play your favorite playlists, or even play something new. This is a big advantage ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå has over Spotify, which requires a more complicated solution using Siri Shortcuts to get ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå to play nice with the Spotify app, and even then it lacks many equivalent features.\n\n\nApple's HomePod speaker is essentially made to be used in conjunction with ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå. In fact, one of the main reasons for ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå on ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå is to control your Apple Music collection. There are ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå voice commands for accessing content like playlists, genres, moods, liking or disliking songs, playing more music based on something you've heard, starting a new radio station, and much more. None of these functions will work with a Spotify subscription -- you can stream audio to ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå from a device running the Spotify app, but that's it.\n\nOn the plus side, Spotify supports lots of different third-party devices, from game consoles to smart speakers. And if you own an Amazon Alexa-enabled speaker you can link it to both Apple Music and Spotify, but check your region first as support can vary depending on where you live.\n\nListening in the Car\n\nApple's CarPlay system supports Spotify and, of course, ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå. If a car doesn't have ‚ÄåCarPlay‚Äå, most newer models have their own entertainment systems, which often make it easy to connect your chosen streaming service. Usually you can do so either direct from a built-in app, over Bluetooth, or via a cable connection.\n\n‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå highlights\nSeamless integration with Apple's eco-system\nBeats live radio and archive\nHuman curated recommendations\nSocial features\nSupport for uploading/matching your own music files\nWorks natively with ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå\n\nSpotify highlights\nExtensive playlist selection\nOfficial web player\nExcellent personalization algorithms\nFree ad-supported tier\n\n‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå vs. Spotify: Which One?\n\nIf you're just looking for a free music streaming service and you don't mind ads, Spotify is the obvious choice. However if you're willing to pay, choosing between Apple Music and Spotify gets tricky. If you're already invested in the Apple ecosystem (perhaps you own an Apple TV or a ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå as well as an ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå) then the decision should be easier, given ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå's hardware integration and its ability to import your existing iTunes music library. But if these aren't considerations, Spotify is certainly a strong alternative, thanks to its excellent music discovery and personalization features.\n\nTags: Spotify, Apple Music Guide\n158 comments\nTop Rated Comments(View all)\nJdshewman\n16 months ago\nI tried Apple Music a couple of times, but it doesn't even come close to Spotify in my opinion. Spotify has far better-curated playlists. They are great at finding music I prefer. I usually listen to a ton of Indie. Too much corporate stuff pushed by Apple Music and all the \"New\" stuff they display are same old stuff. When I go to Spotify my \"Discover Weekly\" playlist is filled with good stuff and hidden gems.

The volcano has a spectacular large crater that contains a lake, which was a popular weekend destination but also the origin of devastating mud flows (lahars). In Oct-Nov 2007, a new lava dome grew within the lake to form an island, replacing most of the water.\nKelut is notorious among Indonesia's volcanoes for its violent, and often deadly explosive eruptions. One of the worst volcanic disasters occurred during the 1919 eruption, when the (then very large) crater lake drained and formed lahars that killed at least 5160 people. An eruption in 1586 is believed to have caused even more than 10,000 fatalities.\nBackground:\nThe relatively inconspicuous, 1731-m-high Kelud stratovolcano contains a summit crater lake that has been the source of some of Indonesia's most deadly eruptions.\nA cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on the eastern, western, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded from Gunung Kelud since 1000 AD. The ejection of water from the crater lake during Kelud's typically short, but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction.\nAfter more than 5000 persons were killed during an eruption in 1919, an ambitious engineering project sought to drain the crater lake. This initial effort lowered the lake by more than 50 m, but the 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after repair of the damaged drainage tunnels.\nAfter more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters.\nKelud Photos:\nThe active lava dome of Kelut volcano in East Java (Nov 2007) (Photo: Tom Pfeiffer)\n\t\nThe growing lava dome of Kelut volcano (East Java, Indonesia) in Nov 2007 (Photo: Tom Pfeiffer)\n\t\nGlowing rock falls from the active lava dome of Kelut volcano (Nov 2007).

Heavy ash fall occurred in distances of up to 200 km, and several airports on Java needed to shut down temporarily.\nKelut volcano eruption update\n\n\n2007 eruption\nThe 2007 eruption was almost purely effusive and built a new lava dome, replacing the previous lake.\nKelud volcano tours\nVolcanoes of Java (17-days walking and trekking tour on Java)\nLatest satellite images\n\nSee also: Sentinel hub | Landsat 8\nLatest news:\nKelut volcano (East Java, Indonesia): alert level lowered\nThursday, Aug 14, 2014\nDue to visual and instrumental monitoring results as well as level of potential hazards the Alert Level for Kelut was lowered to 1 (on a scale of 1-4) on 12 August.

It ends free movement. It takes back control of our borders.\n\n\nKey workers at risk: UK companies accused of overlooking safety (2:27)\n\n\"It gives the government the powers needed to deliver an immigration system that is firm, fair and fit for the future, the points-based system the public voted for, a system that will support our economic recovery by prioritising jobs for people here in the UK while continuing to attract the brightest and the best in terms of global talent.\"\n\nBut Thomas-Symonds replied: \"In the midst of this crisis the government is putting forward an immigration system containing a salary threshold of 25,600 pounds - it sends a signal and tells people that anyone earning less than that is unskilled and unwelcome in our country.\"\n\nThomas-Symonds said the earnings of front-line workers did not reflect their contribution to society, adding: \"Those who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a Bill today that will send a powerful message to those same people - that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers.\n\n\"Are shop workers unskilled? Are refuse collectors? Are local government workers? Are NHS staff? Are care workers? Of course, they are not.\"\n\nSNP immigration spokesman Stuart McDonald criticised the \"dreadful\" legislation, saying: \"It's a Bill that will result in many thousands of EU nationals losing their rights in this country overnight and which will extend the reach of the hostile environment still further.\"\n\nYvette Cooper, Labour chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, said she believes the legislation was \"flawed\", but that she would not oppose it, as immigration legislation was needed.¬†She will put forward amendments which she hopes will receive cross-party support, she said.\n\n\"In that cross-party spirit, I will not vote against the Bill tonight, although if the government's approach does not change, I would expect to oppose it when it returns to the House.\"\n\nLabour's Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said the legislation was \"bad in principle, bad in practice\" and described it as a \"slap in the face for the thousands of migrants, including EU migrants, working so hard for the NHS and care sector in this time of COVID crisis\".\n\nIn February, the government announced proposals for the new system, with points awarded for specific requirements such as being able to speak English to a certain level, having a job offer from an approved employer and meeting a salary threshold.\n\nOther points could be awarded for certain qualifications, and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation.\n\nA visa allowing doctors, nurses and health professionals from overseas to work in the NHS was introduced in March.\n\nSOURCE: NEWS AGENCIES\n\nUnited Kingdom\nImmigration\nEurope\nHave your say.Give us feedback.\nSign up for ourNewsletter.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nRSS\nPodcast\nYouTube\nAbout\nAbout Us\nCode of Ethics\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nCommunity Guidelines\nWork for us\nHR Quality\nConnect\nContact Us\nApps\nSocial\nChannel Finder\nTV Schedule\nPodcasts\nNewsletter\nSubmit a Tip\nDirectory\nOur Channels\nAl Jazeera Arabic\nAl Jazeera English\nAl Jazeera Mubasher\nAl Jazeera Documentary\nAl Jazeera Balkans\nAJ+\nOur Network\nJetty\nAl Jazeera Centre for Studies\nAl Jazeera Media Institute\nLearn Arabic\nAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\nAl Jazeera Forum\nAl Jazeera Film Festival\nAl Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\n¬© 2020 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n¬†\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best possible experience.

Cuomo‚Äôs televised daily press conferences ‚Äì calm, measured and honest ‚Äì have emerged as the rival to Trump‚Äôs chaotic and misleading evening broadcasts.\n\nThough Cuomo has vociferously denied harboring presidential ambitions, it is telling that speculation about a future Cuomo run for the White House is now one of the hottest topics in US politics ‚Äì a remarkable turnaround for a politician widely disliked by America‚Äôs resurgent left wing.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n Andrew Cuomo speaks as the navy hospital ship USNS Comfort arrives in Manhattan‚Äôs Pier 90 to help relieve the strain on local hospitals. Photograph: Ron Adar/SOPA Images/REX\n\nBut the age of the coronavirus has upset conventional politics around the globe and there is no doubt Cuomo has seized his moment.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been very very impressed by the way in which he‚Äôs approached it,‚Äù the former Washington governor Gary Locke, an ex-chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said. ‚ÄúVery frank, very honest ‚Äì upfront. Preparing the people, presenting facts so that the public is not caught off guard, they know what to expect. He‚Äôs very even-keeled and I think the public appreciates that. He‚Äôs not trying to gloss over things, the magnitude, the severity of the pandemic.‚Äù\n\nGovernors are usually some of the more aloof elected officials in the pantheon of American politicians. Often they‚Äôre less well-known than senators or members of Congress, and their power varies from state to state.\n\n \n\nI‚Äôm worried about my brother, as everyone is worried about everyone they love\n\nCuomo on his brother who has Covid-19\n\nIt‚Äôs virtually unheard of for any politician ‚Äì other than the president ‚Äì to have his press conferences aired live on major cable networks daily, but that‚Äôs just what has happened with Cuomo. Cuomo‚Äôs briefings always feature the governor and his deputies on a panel, with Cuomo delivering an update on the number of infected cases in New York and then a description of how his administration is fighting the virus.\n\nOften ‚Äì and unlike Trump ‚Äì Cuomo will admit where New York is falling short on equipment. He is frank that the crisis won‚Äôt end tomorrow or any time soon.\n\n‚ÄúIn general, I am tired of being behind this virus. We‚Äôve been behind this virus since day one,‚Äù Cuomo said at a press conference last week. ‚ÄúEverybody wants to know one thing: when is it over? Nobody knows. ‚ÄòWell, the president said by Easter, this one said by this‚Äô ‚Ä¶ nobody knows. But I can say this: it is not going to be soon.‚Äù\n\nHe will also, without hesitation, praise the Trump administration when he feels it is merited and then separate himself from the president the next minute. He will also share when he‚Äôs recently had a call with Vice-President Mike Pence or Jared Kushner, the president‚Äôs son-in-law and an influential adviser in the Trump administration. He has repeatedly stressed New York‚Äôs deficit of ventilators.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n Members of the national guard await the arrival of Governor Andrew Cuomo at the Javits convention center, which is being turned into a hospital to help fight coronavirus cases in New York City. Photograph: Eduardo Mu√±oz/Getty Images\n\n‚ÄúThe federal government is a partner in this obviously. I spoke to the president again yesterday about the situation, I spoke to the vice-president, I spoke to Jared Kushner,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúThe White house has been very helpful.‚Äù\n\nCuomo‚Äôs visibility is a dramatic flip from just a few months ago, before the coronavirus crisis.\n\nFor years he‚Äôs been known as a technocratic governor reviled by the most hardcore liberal sections of the Democratic party. He has cut deals with Republicans and repeatedly angered progressives. Many Democrats sometimes snicker at the thought of him doing retail politics in early voting states like Iowa, where endless hours of handshakes and diner visits are seen as non-negotiable facts of campaign life.\n\nYet Cuomo‚Äôs New York speeches, his personal tangents about how his mother is responding to the pandemic or how frightened he is about his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, having contracted coronavirus, have matched the moment more than any other governor in the nation.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm frightened for my brother. I‚Äôm worried about my brother ‚Äì as everyone is worried about their humanity and everyone they love,‚Äù Cuomo said at his press conference on Wednesday as news of Chris‚Äôs infection broke.\n\nNew York politicians are constantly under the national spotlight. Rudy Giuliani became ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs mayor‚Äù for how he handled the city‚Äôs response to the attacks on the World Trade Center. More recently, at the beginning of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was a top-tier contender before failing to gain any real traction.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n The Cuomo family: from left to right, Maria, 15, Madeline, 12, Andrew, 19, Margaret, 22, father Mario, Christopher, seven, and mother Matilda at their home in 1977. Photograph: George Argeroplos/Newsday LLC/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\nCuomo‚Äôs name had been bandied about as a potential candidate for 2020 but he took only a modest look at running for president before deciding against it, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those considerations.\n\nLeftwing opponents\n\nCuomo has never been a friend of grassroots progressives and he has repeatedly defeated leftwing challengers. When he ran for re-election in 2014, his more liberal primary opponent, Zephyr Teachout, became a national progressive icon for challenging the establishment-aligned Cuomo. In 2018, when Cuomo ran again, he faced another challenge from his left, that time from the former Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon, who became the darling of liberals hoping to oust the incumbent governor.\n\nThe common liberal critique of Cuomo is that his administration has been rife with corruption and his agenda has been too deferential to centrists and the right.\n\n‚ÄúThe Democratic party has spent the past two decades moving away from its New Deal values and refusing to unequivocally stand up for working people ‚Äì and Governor Cuomo embodies this shift to the center,‚Äù said Monica Klein, a New York-based progressive Democratic strategist.\n\n‚ÄúThe governor has consistently led New York as a corporate Democrat ‚Äì slashing funding for hospitals, public schools and affordable housing instead of raising taxes on the wealthy. If Democrats want to take back the White House, we need to once again become the party for working people ‚Äì and leaders like Cuomo are doing the exact opposite,‚Äù Klein added.\n\nCuomo is certainly party establishment.\n\nHe is the son of the former New York governor Mario Cuomo, who memorably decided against running for president at the last moment in 1992. He has known Trump for years. His personal life has been the subject of local and national scrutiny. His first marriage was to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Robert F Kennedy. Cuomo‚Äôs romances and breakups have been documented in the New York and national press (including more recently his breakup with longtime partner and Food Network star Sandra Lee).\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n New York Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo celebrates with his father Mario Cuomo and mother Matilda Cuomo at the Sheraton New York on 2 November 2010. Photograph: Michael Nagle/Getty Images\n\nThese days, Cuomo‚Äôs prominence has earned him a new level of attention. His press conferences have even sparked speculation around the internet over whether he sports a nipple ring.\n\nBut it is Cuomo‚Äôs actions that have won him acclaim. He has taken an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach to fighting the virus. He has pleaded for more ventilators, worked with the federal government, issued strict edicts on isolating, and talked with business leaders privately.\n\nCuomo Prime Time\n(@CuomoPrimeTime)\n\nNew York Gov.

Apple's focus on AR/VR has ramped up over the past few years, and an augmented reality product could launch as soon as 2021.\nRUMORED PRODUCTS\nUltra-powerful AR/VR headset\nAugmented reality smart glasses\nLAST UPDATED 6 hours ago\nHighlight Recent Changes\nYes\nNo\n\nSubscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Glasses info.\n\nApple's Secret Augmented and Virtual Reality Project\nContents\nApple's Secret Augmented and Virtual Reality Project\nAR Smart Glasses\nAR Headset\nA Powerful AR/VR Headset\niOS 14 AR Leaks\nAR in Xcode\nValve Partnership?\nOther Rumors\nAugmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality\nApple's VR/AR Team\nHires\nAcquisitions\nAR/VR Patents\nLaunch Date\nApple Glasses Timeline\n\nApple has been exploring virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for more than 10 years based on patent filings, but with virtual and augmented reality exploding in popularity with the launch of ARKit, Apple's dabbling is growing more serious and could lead to an actual dedicated AR/VR product in the future.\n\nApple is rumored to have a secret research unit comprising hundreds of employees working on AR and VR, exploring ways the emerging technologies could be used in future Apple products. VR/AR hiring has ramped up and Apple has acquired multiple AR/VR companies as it furthers its work in the AR/VR space.\n\nApple has been rumored to be working on multiple virtual and augmented reality headset prototypes as engineers search for the \"most compelling application\" for such a device, and current rumors indicate that Apple's first product will be an augmented reality headset and/or glasses.\n\nAccording to The Information, Apple is working on two AR projects, including an augmented reality headset set to be released in 2022 followed by a sleeker pair of augmented reality glasses coming in 2023, but many rumors have focused solely on the glasses, leading to some confusion about Apple's plans.\n\nAR Smart Glasses\n\nApple is working on a set of augmented reality glasses, which Leaker Jon Prosser has suggested Apple will call the smart glasses the \"Apple Glass.\" That name would be an unusual choice given the similarity to the name of Google Glass, a product that existed long before Apple's work on AR glasses came to light.\n\nThe glasses are said to look similar to regular glasses, with both lenses to feature displays that can be interacted with using gestures. There will be an option to get the glasses with no prescription lenses at a possible starting price of $499, with prescription lenses available at an additional cost.\n\nWell-respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the AR glasses to be marketed as an iPhone accessory and will primarily take a display role offloading computing, networking, and positioning to the iPhone. Offering the AR glasses as an iPhone accessory will allow Apple to keep them slim and lightweight.\n\nBloomberg has said the Apple glasses will run \"rOS\" or reality operating system. rOS is said to be based on iOS, the operating system that runs on the iPhone. For the AR headset, Apple is developing a \"system-on-a-package\" chip similar to what's in the Apple Watch, though it will rely on the iPhone as mentioned above.\n\nOver the course of developing an AR headset, Apple has considered touch panels, voice activation, and head gestures as input methods, and a range of applications from mapping to texting are being prototyped. Virtual meeting rooms and 360-degree video playback are also concepts that are being explored.\n\nThought there were initial rumors of a 2020 launch, Bloomberg believes an AR/VR headset could come as early as 2021. A report from DigiTimes suggests Apple's AR glasses could launch by 2022, and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects a 2022 launch at the earliest.\n\nLeaker Jon Prosser believes Apple will unveil its AR glasses in March or June of 2021, which could mean the glasses will be shown off in 2021 and then released later in 2022.\n\nAR Headset\n\nThe Information has said that Apple is working on both smart glasses and an AR headset, with the headset to come out in 2021 followed by the glasses in 2022.\n\nDetails on Apple's work on an AR headset were allegedly shared by Apple in an internal employee meeting, where Apple execs are said to have highlighted features like 3D scanning and advanced human detection.\n\nThe headset is rumored to be similar to Facebook's Oculus Quest virtual reality headset, but with a sleeker design that uses fabrics and lightweight materials to ensure the headset is comfortable.\n\nIt's said to feature a high-resolution display and cameras that will let users \"read small type\" and \"see other people standing in front of and behind virtual objects.\" The headset will be able to map surfaces, edges, and dimensions of rooms with \"greater accuracy than existing devices on the market.\"\n\nA Powerful AR/VR Headset\n\nAlong with augmented reality smart glasses of some kind, rumors have suggested that Apple is working on an incredibly powerful AR/VR headset that's not quite like anything else on the market. It is said to feature an 8K display for each eye that would be untethered from either a computer or a smartphone, and it would work with both virtual and augmented reality applications.\n\nRather than relying on a connection to a smartphone or a computer, the headset would connect to a \"dedicated box\" using a high-speed short-range wireless technology called 60GHz WiGig. The box would be powered by a custom 5-nanometer Apple processor that's \"more powerful than anything currently available.\" At the current time, the box apparently resembles a PC tower, but it \"won't be an actual Mac computer.\"\n\nTo use the headset, users will not need to install special cameras in a room to detect their location as with some available VR headsets. All of the technology will be built into the headset and the box.\n\nApple is said to be aiming to launch this AR/VR headset in 2020, but the company's plans could be delayed or scrapped.\n\niOS 14 AR Leaks\n\nCode and images found in iOS 14 confirm Apple's work on an AR or VR headset, with a photo discovered that depicts a generic-looking controller for a headset that's similar in design to the HTC Vive Focus headset. Apple has been using HTC Vive hardware for internal testing purposes.\n\nApple is testing its AR equipment with an iOS 14 app called Gobi along with QR codes to test augmented reality experiences. One of these augmented reality experiences is a crosswalk bowling game triggered at a specific crosswalk in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nAR in Xcode\n\nCode in the Xcode 11 confirms Apple's work on some kind of AR headset. There are references to codenamed test devices plus frameworks and a system shell related to these devices. The references suggest Apple is developing support for a face-mounted AR experience that's similar to Google's Daydream.\n\nValve Partnership?\n\nAccording to Taiwanese site DigiTimes, Apple is partnering with game developer Valve for its rumored AR headset. Valve released its first VR headset, Valve Index, in April 2019.\n\nValve previously worked with Apple to bring native VR headset support to macOS High Sierra, leveraging the eGPU support with a Mac version of the SteamVR software.\n\nOther Rumors\n\nIn November of 2017, Apple purchased Vrvana, a company that developed a mixed reality headset called Totem. Vrvana's technology could potentially be used in a future Apple headset. Apple followed its purchase of Vrvana with an acquisition of Akonia Holographics, a company that makes lenses for AR smart glasses.\n\nRumors have also suggested Apple could incorporate its augmented reality research into its ongoing car project as part of an in-car software system that could include a heads-up display or other features.\n\nAugmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality\n\nAugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are similar technologies, but there's a major difference between them and their potential applications vary widely. Virtual reality refers to a full immersive experience in a virtual world, while augmented reality refers to a modified view of the real world.\n\nThe difference can perhaps be best summed up by a comparison between two products, one AR and one VR. Google Glass, Google's now-defunct set of smart glasses, is an example of augmented reality. The eye-worn Google Glass let users view the world as it is, but it offered a heads-up display that overlaid relevant computer-provided information over that real world view, such as local weather, maps, and notifications.\n\nThis is similar to what Apple is said to be working on with its \"smart glasses\" or augmented reality headset.\n\nIn comparison, Facebook's Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset offering an immersive visual experience that doesn't augment the real world with additional sensory information -- it fully replaces the real world with a simulated world.\n\nAugmented reality provides computer-generated context and information about the world around us while allowing us to interact with our surroundings, while virtual reality is designed to isolate us from our surroundings so we can interact with fictitious worlds.\n\nPotential applications for the two are vastly different. Virtual reality is singularly focused on immersive content consumption because it makes the wearer feel as if they're actually experiencing what's going on in the simulated world through visual, tactile, and audio feedback. Virtual reality is largely linked to gaming right now, but it also has the potential to recreate real world experiences for educational or training purposes.\n\nAugmented reality doesn't hinge on immersive content and while less exciting because it's augmenting reality instead of replacing it, it has a wider range of potential applications. In fact, augmented reality apps and games are readily available in iOS 11 thanks to ARKit.\n\nWith ARKit, an iOS device is able to identify a surface like a table, and then virtual objects can be added to it. Because of the computing power of the iPhone and the iPad, ARKit's augmented reality capabilities are impressive. ARKit is already being used to create a huge range of apps and games, blending digital objects with the real world.\n\nApple may aim for a product that works with both augmented and virtual reality, as suggested by recent rumors indicating work on an AR/VR headset that would connect via Wi-Fi to a PC-like box that features a powerful processor. Such a product could be used for serious virtual reality applications as well as augmented reality experiences.\n\nIn macOS High Sierra, Apple introduced for VR in Metal 2 and partnering with Valve, Unity, and Unreal to bring VR creation tools to the Mac, which could hints at some kind of future hardware. At the very least, Apple's latest Macs and upcoming iMac Pro will support existing virtual reality hardware and VR content creation.\n\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple's AirPods and its rumored high-end over-ear headphones are the future of Apple's AI and augmented reality ambitions. He believes the two audio devices will complement Apple's rumored augmented reality glasses.\n\nApple's VR/AR Team\n\nApple's work on virtual and augmented reality dates back multiple years, but rumors picked up starting in March of 2015 when news hit that Apple had a small team of people working on augmented reality. In 2015 and into early 2016, Apple's team grew as the company hired employees with expertise in AR/VR technology and made multiple related acquisitions.\n\nApple's AR/VR team includes several hundred engineers from across Apple, all of whom have expertise in virtual and augmented reality. The team works across office parks in both Cupertino and Sunnyvale, and Apple is exploring several hardware and software projects under the code name \"T288.\"\n\nApple's augmented reality team combines \"the strengths of its hardware and software veterans,\" and is led by Mike Rockwell, who came from Dolby. Former employees of companies like Oculus, HoloLens, Amazon (from the VR team), 3D animation company Weta Digital, and Lucasfilm are working on AR at Apple.\n\nApple developers have also joined the WebVR community group dedicated to make VR content viewable on any device and on the web.\n\nHires\n\nOne of Apple's most prominent AR/VR hires was computer science professor Doug Bowman, who previously led the Virginia Tech's Center for Human-Computer Interaction. He specializes in three-dimensional user interface design and has written a book on the subject covering 3D interfaces and the benefits of immersive virtual environments. He has expertise with both virtual and augmented reality.\n\nApple has also hired employees that have worked on virtual or augmented reality products at Microsoft and Lytro. Some recent hires are said to be from Microsoft's HoloLens team, while others worked at Lytro, a company working on a camera able to blend live action and computer graphics for a live action VR experience. Employees coming from the HoloLens team would have experience creating an advanced augmented reality headset.\n\nThe Lytro Immerge 360 degree camera\n\nZeyu Li, who served as a principal computer vision engineer at Magic Leap (a startup developing a head-mounted AR/VR display), is now working at Apple as a \"Senior Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer.\"\n\nYury Petrov, a former research scientist at Facebook-owned Oculus, is now serving as a \"research scientist\" at Apple. According to his LinkedIn profile, Petrov studied virtual reality experiences, prototyped optics, and developed computer simulation software.\n\nAugmented reality expert Jeff Norris joined Apple in April 2017 as a senior manager working on the company's augmented reality team. Norris founded the Mission Operations Innovation Office and JPL Ops Lab at NASA. He led multiple projects focused on human-system interaction with an emphasis on virtual and augmented reality.\n\nApple in May 2018 2018 hired Sterling Crispin, who developed a painting app for mobile VR headsets. \"Cyber Paint\" let VR headset wearers create 2D 260-degree pictures on Oculus Go, Daydream, GearVR, and Vive Focus. Crispin's LinkedIn page says he is working as a \"prototyping researcher,\" suggesting he has jointed the team rumored to be working on VR/AR headset technology.\n\nApple in December 2018 hired former senior Tesla and Microsoft HoloLens designer Andrew Kim, and given his history, he could be working on Apple's rumored AR glasses project or its upcoming Apple car that's said to be in development.\n\nJaunt VR founder Arthur van Hoff joined Apple as a senior architect in April 2019. Prior to working at Apple, his company created VR hardware, including a $100,000 3D VR camera called the Jaunt One. Prior to when van Hoff left the company, Jaunt failed and pivoted to AR experiences.\n\nWith Apple's team encompassing hundreds of employees, there are many other virtual reality expert hires that have gone under the radar. On LinkedIn, there are multiple software engineers with virtual reality experience that are employed by Apple, but it is unclear if they work on the secret AR/VR team.\n\nApple in July 2019 moved Kim Vorrath, one of its software executives, over to the augmented reality headset division to \"bring some order\" to the team. Vorrath has overseen program management on the software development team for 15 years, and has been described as a \"powerful force\" making sure employees meet deadlines while also sussing out bugs.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nMany members of Apple's AR/VR team may have joined the company though acquisitions. Since 2015, Apple has purchased several companies that created AR/VR-related products, and some of its AR/VR acquisitions even date back several years.\n\nAkonia Holographics\n\nApple in August 2018 bought Akonia Holographics, a startup that makes lenses for augmented reality glasses. Akonia Holographics advertises the \"world's first commercially available volume holographic reflective and waveguide optics for transparent display elements in smart glasses.\"\n\nThe displays that it makes are said to use the company's HoloMirror technology for \"ultra-clear, full-color performance\" to enable the \"thinnest, lightest head worn displays in the world.\"\n\nVrvana\n\nIn November of 2017, Apple purchased Vrvana, a company that developed a mixed reality headset called Totem. Totem, which was never released to the public, was designed to combine both augmented and virtual reality technologies in a single headset, merging full VR capabilities with pass-through cameras to enable screen-based augmented reality features.\n\nTotem essentially used a set of cameras to project real world images into its built-in 1440p OLED display, a somewhat unique approach that set it apart from competing products like Microsoft's HoloLens, which uses a transparent display to combine virtual and augmented reality. Apple could be planning to use some of Totem's technology in a future product.\n\nPrimeSense\n\nApple purchased Israeli-based 3D body sensing firm PrimeSense in 2013, sparking speculation that motion-based capabilities would be implemented into the Apple TV. PrimeSense's 3D depth technology and motion sensing capabilities were used in Microsoft's initial Kinect platform.\n\nPrimeSense used near-IR light to project an invisible light into a room or a scene, which is then read by a CMOS image sensor to create a virtual image of an object or person. This enables motion-based controls for software interfaces, but it's also able to do things like measure virtual objects and provide relative distances or sizes, useful for augmented reality applications like interactive gaming, indoor mapping, and more. PrimeSense technology can also create highly accurate 360 degree scans of people and objects, potentially useful for virtual reality applications.\n\nMetaio\n\nApple acquired augmented reality startup Metaio in May of 2015. Metaio built a product called the Metaio Creator, which could be used to create augmented reality scenarios in just a few minutes. Prior to being purchased by Apple, Metaio's software was used by companies like Ferrari, who created an augmented reality showroom.\n\nMetaio technology was also used in Berlin to allow people visiting the site of the Berlin Wall to use a smartphone or tablet to see what the area looked like when the Berlin Wall was still standing. Metaio's technology is one that could potentially be used to implement augmented reality capabilities into Apple apps like Maps.\n\nFaceshift\n\nApple acquired Faceshift in August of 2015, marking its second augmented reality purchase in 2015. Before being acquired by Apple, Faceshift worked with game and animation studios on technology designed to quickly and accurately capture facial expressions using 3D sensors, transforming them into animated faces in real time. Faceshift was also working on a consumer-oriented product that would allow people to morph their faces into cartoon or monster faces in real time in Skype.\n\nFaceshift's technology has a wide range of possible use cases, and Apple appears to be using the feature to power Animoji in the iPhone X.\n\nEmotient\n\nEmotient, a company that built tools for facial expression analysis, was acquired by Apple in January of 2016. Emotient's technology uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to read human emotion, features that have been used in the real world by advertisers to determine emotional reactions to advertisements.\n\nThere are dozens of things Apple could do with Emotient, ranging from better facial detection in the Photos app to analyzing customer feelings in Apple retail stores to unlocking iOS devices, but it also has potential AR/VR uses. Like Faceshift, Emotient's technology could be used to analyze and transform facial expressions for the creation of virtual avatars, useful for social media purposes and games. Emotient technology was likely used for Animoji.\n\nFlyby Media\n\nPurchased in early 2016, Flyby Media is another company that worked on augmented reality. Flyby created an app that worked with Google's 3D sensor-equipped \"Project Tango\" smartphone, allowing messages to be attached to real world objects and viewed by others with one of Google's devices.\n\nA look at the Flyby Messenger app before it was pulled from the App Store, via TechCrunch\n\nFor example, a person could \"scan\" a landmark like San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and write a message attached to it. A person visiting the bridge later would then be able to scan the bridge with the Flyby app to see the message. The Flyby app likely drew the attention of Apple because it was able to recognize and understand different objects that were scanned, technology that could be used by Apple in a number of ways in apps like Photos and Maps.\n\nRealFace\n\nIn February of 2017, Apple purchased RealFace, a cybersecurity and machine learning company that specializes in facial recognition technology, which could potentially be used for future augmented reality features.\n\nRealFace developed facial recognition technology integrating artificial intelligence for frictionless face recognition. Realface technology was likely employed in the iPhone X, Apple's first smartphone with facial recognition capabilities in the form of Face ID.\n\nNextVR\n\nApple in May 2020 acquired NextVR, a California-based company that combined virtual reality with sports, music, and entertainment, offering VR experiences for watching live events on VR headsets from PlayStation, HTC, Oculus, Google, Microsoft, and other manufacturers.\n\nAR/VR Patents\n\nApple has filed at multiple patents that relate directly to a virtual reality headset, all dating back several years. While technology has likely advanced somewhat beyond these, they provide an interesting look at the ideas Apple has explored in the past.\n\nA 2008 patent application covered a fairly basic \"personal display system\" designed to mimic the experience of being in a movie theater when watching video.\n\nA second patent described a \"Head Mounted Display System\" with a \"laser engine\" that projected images onto a clear glass display worn over the eyes, similar to glasses. In this configuration, the headset connected to a handheld video player such as an iPod to provide processing power.\n\nA third patent originally filed for in 2008 was similar in design, covering a goggle-like video headset designed to let users watch movies and other content. It outlined two adjustable optical modules lined up with the user's eye, which could provide vision correction and allow for the viewing of 3D content. Apple described this as offering a personal media viewing experience.\n\nA fourth patent from 2008 covered a video headset frame similar to the Google Glass, which would allow a user to slide their iPhone or iPod into the headset to provide video. The headset was described as an augmented reality product that would let users do things like watch a video or check email while keeping an eye on their surroundings.\n\nBeyond headset-related patents, Apple has also filed for patents describing other ways virtual and augmented reality features could be implemented into its devices. A 2009 patent application, for example, covered camera-equipped 3D displays that would shift in perspective based on a user's relative position.\n\nSuch a display would detect head movement, allowing a user to move their head around to look at a 3D image from different angles while also incorporating elements of a user's environment.\n\n2010 and 2012 patents described the use of motion sensors to create a 3D interface for iOS devices using augmented reality techniques. Apple described the interface as a \"virtual room\" navigated by manipulating the orientation of the device through built-in sensors or through gestures.\n\nIn 2011, Apple filed a patent for an augmented reality feature in the Maps app related to mapping the distance to notable landmarks. With the camera, a user could look at the area around them and get real-time estimations of the distance between two points along with overlays of relevant information.\n\nA patent filed in 2014 and granted in 2017 covers a mobile augmented reality system able to detect objects in the environment and overlay them with virtual information through the use of cameras, a screen, and a user interface. Apple describes the system as ideal for a head-mounted display, but it also shows it being used in smartphones.\n\nApple has been working on virtual reality technology that could be used within autonomous vehicles. Several Apple patents describe a system that includes an in-car virtual reality system with a VR headset worn to provide entertainment and to mitigate carsickness from tasks like reading and working while a vehicle is in motion.\n\nLaunch Date\n\nApple has been working on some kind of AR headset since 2016 and early rumors indicated Apple wanted to launch a product by 2019. That didn't happen, and current rumors indicate we could see the first augmented reality glasses or headset-type product in late 2021 or early 2022.\n\nApple Glasses Timeline\nMAY\n2020\nMay 19\n'Apple Glass' Rumored to Start at $499, Support Prescription Lenses, and More\nMay 15\nApple Glasses Could Be Unveiled in Mid 2021 and Made Available to Order in 2022\nMay 14\nApple Acquires Virtual Reality Company NextVR\nMay 14\nKuo: Apple Glasses to Launch in 2022 at Earliest, New 10.8-Inch iPad and 9-Inch iPad Mini Coming in 2020/2021\nAPRIL\n2020\nApr 6\nApple Reportedly Acquiring NextVR for $100 Million\nMARCH\n2020\nMar 30\nApple Reportedly Looked at Acquiring Augmented Reality Display Maker Plessey\nMar 26\nApple Testing AR/VR Headset With HTC Vive-Like Controller, Crosswalk Bowling Game, and More\nMar 24\nApple's AR Glasses Could Launch by 2022 as Suppliers Reportedly Ramp Up Development\nNOVEMBER\n2019\nNov 11\nNew AR Sensor Coming to 2020 iPad Pro and iPhone Models, AR/VR Headset as Soon as 2021\nNov 11\nApple Said to Release AR Headset With 3D Scanning in 2022, Followed by Sleeker Glasses in 2023\nNov 4\nDigiTimes: Apple Partnering With Valve to Develop AR Headset\nOCTOBER\n2019\nOct 21\nBloomberg: Apple Targets 2020 for Release of AR Headset, Apple Watch Sleep Tracking, and Arm-Based Macs\nOct 9\nKuo: Apple's AR Headset to Launch in Second Quarter of 2020\nSEPTEMBER\n2019\nSep 10\nXcode 11 GM Confirms Apple's Work on AR Headset\nSep 2\nApple Watch Sleep Tracking, Schooltime Mode, AR/VR Headset Icon, and More Revealed in iOS 13 Code\nSep 2\niOS 13 Code Suggests Apple Testing AR Headset With 'StarBoard' Mode, 'Garta' Codename, and More [Updated]\nJULY\n2019\nJul 31\nApple Shifts 'Bug Wrangler' to AR Team to 'Bring Some Order' to AR Headset Development\nJul 11\nDigiTimes: Apple Has Temporarily Stopped Developing AR/VR Headsets, Team Disbanded in May [Updated]\nAPRIL\n2019\nApr 9\nApple Hires Jaunt VR Founder Arthur van Hoff\nMARCH\n2019\nMar 8\nKuo: Apple's AR Glasses to Launch in 2020 as iPhone Accessory\n\n¬†\n\nMacRumors attracts a broad audience of both consumers and professionals interested in the latest technologies and products.

new flagship sedan, inside and out, for you leak lovers.\n\nSEE ALL 31 PHOTOS\n\nGreg FinkWordsMay 12, 2020\n\nSomeone may be out of a job in Stuttgart, Germany. We assume so much, at least, given that images of a near-totally camouflage-free 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class¬†sedan recently leaked onto the web. Credit Instagram user CocheSpias for posting pictures of what looks like the exterior and interior of the three-pointed star's next-generation flagship sedan.\n\nAs predicted, the W223 S-Class evolves upon the styling of its predecessor while also adding in the brand's latest design details and technological flourishes. In short, no one will confuse this big four-door for anything but a Mercedes. As on the recently updated E-Class mid-size sedan, the forthcoming S-Class boasts a prominent grille and a set of swollen headlight bezels that bleed into its wide front fenders. The rear end, meanwhile, trades the current S's vertical taillights for a horizontal design that mimics the looks of other Mercedes models', including the A-Class, CLA-Class, and CLS-Class sedans.\n\nSEE ALL 31 PHOTOS\n\nThe big‚Äîand we mean big‚Äînews resides within the cabin of the S-Class. As previously reported, the new sedan features a massive touchscreen in its center console. The dashboard also includes an equally large digital gauge cluster and head-up display (the latter of which is likely optional). Mercedes-Benz's latest touch-sensitive steering wheel serves as the driver's connection with the road. That said, we expect the upcoming big Benz sedan to offer SAE Level 3 semi-autonomous driving technology, which may give S-Class drivers the opportunity to take their hands off the wheel in certain driving situations. Such instances will surely serve as a prime opportunity for the driver to clean off fingerprint smudges that are sure to mar the car's many screens and piano black trim pieces.\n\nLike its forebears, the best seats in this Benz's cabin are likely its back ones. Plentiful stretch-out space, comfortable cushions, and‚Äîat least in the case of this specific car‚Äîa myriad of screens ensure S-Class passengers enjoy near-complete relaxation (we count three: one aft of each front seat and another in the fold-down console).\n\nMercedes-Benz Vision EQS Concept Shows Off Awesome Illuminating Grille\n2016 Lagonda Taraf by Aston Martin: Meet the World‚Äôs First Million Dollar Four-Door\n5 Cool Things: the All-New 2020 Hyundai Palisade\nWatch This!

What we don't know is exactly what this new entry will be all about. Last year, rumours circulated that the 2020 title will be a return to the Black Ops universe, primarily developed by Treyarch, and will be set during the Cold War. That's all sounding a little more likely, as a new video from TheGamingRevolution brings up many of the same points.\n\nThere's a fair amount to digest from the video, but let's go over some of the main points of interest. According to TheGamingRevolution and his sources, this year's entry in the franchise will be a gritty reboot of Call of Duty: Black Ops in much the same way as 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The events you'll play through in the campaign will allegedly be based on events during the Cold War and Vietnam War, and the story will be entirely new. Characters from the original Black Ops games will make a return with new actors, as with Captain Price. Finally, the codename for the game is apparently Project Zeus, but the likely official title will simply be Call of Duty: Black Ops.\n\nThe video goes on to talk about multiplayer details, but above are the key things about what this game will be. It's worth noting that none of this could turn out to be true, but it does tally with what's been said in the past. Given that Treyarch is leading development on the project, a Black Ops game seems likely, and the success of Modern Warfare's return means another reboot makes sense. Still, take it all with a pinch of salt, as usual.\n\nHopefully we'll learn official details about the game soon. Do you want to see a Black Ops reboot in this year's Call of Duty?

Gamers will be expecting yet another hard-hitting roster of exclusives when the PlayStation 5 launches late in 2020, and recent leaks claim the PS5 lineup will include a reboot of the iconic horror series Silent Hill.\n\nBut there‚Äôs one catch that might prematurely disappoint fans of the franchise.\n\nTrusted games leaker Dusk Golem tweeted Wednesday night that Konami‚Äôs reported PS5 relaunch of Silent Hill in partnership with SIE Japan will not involve the revival of Hideo Kojima‚Äôs Silent Hills. However, the companies have allegedly reunited many of the creative minds that helped make the series so popular in the late '90s and early '00s.\n\nAs a reminder, the last major installment of the series ‚Äî Silent Hill: Downpour ‚Äî was released in 2012. Kojima then announced that he was taking over the Konami-owned franchise with the 2014 release of P.T., an extremely popular demo of what was eventually supposed to be a full-length game titled Silent Hills.\n\n'Death Stranding' designer Hideo Kojima will reportedly not be involved with the rumored 'Silent Hill' reboot.Stanislav Krasilnikov/TASS/Getty Images\n\nBut after Kojima‚Äôs public falling out with Konami, plans for Silent Hills were scrapped and remain dead to this day, according to Dusk Golem. But the leaker reassured fans that Konami and SIE Japan are cooking up a ‚Äúsoft reboot‚Äù of the series that won‚Äôt have anything to do with Kojima‚Äôs take on the game. It will bring back Silent Hill after nearly a decade of being dormant.\n\nHere‚Äôs the full rundown of details Dusk Golem tweeted out:\n\nIt is developed by Sony Japan Studios and will be [a] PS5 exclusive.\n[Original Silent Hill director and writer Keiichiro] Toyama is directing, [original Silent Hill composer] Akira Yaomoka is composing, [original Silent Hill illustrator] Masahiro Ito is doing art, various Siren [and] Gravity Rush devs and some others working on it.\nThis has nothing to do with Kojima or Silent Hills, that probably is not happening.\nSony is NOT buying IPs, that‚Äôs bullshit.\nThe game is NOT a remake, it is a soft reboot, made so it can be someone's first Silent Hill game.\nThe game is playable & has a demo that will be shown around after reveal.\nAfter nearly a decade, gamers might get a new 'Silent Hill' demo soon.Konami\n\nTHE INVERSE ANALYSIS ‚Äî While Dusk Golem didn‚Äôt explicitly say when gamers should expect an announcement for the Silent Hill revival, past leaks and recent news about Sony‚Äôs PS5 plans could provide some clues.\n\nDusk Golem previously tweeted that development for the reboot had started a year ago under Ito‚Äôs leadership, and this tip was then corroborated by horror-game focused publication Rely on Horror. Dusk Golem now claims that Konami and SIE Japan have a demo ready to go, which could be live-streamed ‚Äî or even released ‚Äî very soon.\n\nSony is reportedly planning on hosting a PS5 reveal event in June where the company will be expected to showcase what the console will look like and potentially some exclusive game teasers. This could include an announcement of Silent Hill if the game is as far along as Dusk Golem claims.\n\nSony has teased only a few PS5 launch titles, so the rebirth of Silent Hills could create some hype for the console‚Äôs launch during the 2020 holiday season.\n\nRELATED TAGS\nVIDEO GAMES\nShare:\nSCIENCE\nINNOVATION\nENTERTAINMENT\nMIND AND BODY\nGAMING\nCULTURE\nNEWSLETTERS\nSMALL BUSINESS\nABOUT\nNEWSLETTER\nTERMS\nTOPICS\nPRIVACY\nARCHIVE\nDMCA\nBROWSE\nADVERTISE\nETHICS\nCONTACT\nINVERSE ¬© 2020 Bustle Digital Group"},"_id":"5ec92e8780ac707a3ee5ef63","id":"PS5SilentHill","tweetId":"1263442386249793539","type":"Good","tweetContent":"Silent Hill - PS5 Exclusive \n\n‚Äúis developed by Sony Japan Studios &amp; will be PS5 exclusive‚Äù\n\nis a ‚Äúa soft reboot‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAkira Yaomoka is composing, Masahiro Ito is doing art, various Siren/Gravity Rush devs &amp; some others working on it.‚Äù \n- Dusk Golem \n\n#Rumour #PS5 https://t.co/duqc8Qil07","originalTweet":{"created_at":"Thu May 21 12:11:53 +0000 2020","id":1263442386249793500,"id_str":"1263442386249793539","full_text":"Silent Hill - PS5 Exclusive \n\n‚Äúis developed by Sony Japan Studios &amp; will be PS5 exclusive‚Äù\n\nis a ‚Äúa soft reboot‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAkira Yaomoka is composing, Masahiro Ito is doing art, various Siren/Gravity Rush devs &amp; some others working on it.‚Äù \n- Dusk Golem \n\n#Rumour #PS5 https://t.co/duqc8Qil07","truncated":false,"display_text_range":[0,269],"entities":{"hashtags":[{"text":"Rumour","indices":[257,264]},{"text":"PS5","indices":[265,269]}],"symbols":[],"user_mentions":[],"urls":[],"media":[{"id":1263442383062081500,"id_str":"1263442383062081536","indices":[270,293],"media_url":"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYimJ0SWoAA3_Jo.jpg","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYimJ0SWoAA3_Jo.jpg","url":"https://t.co/duqc8Qil07","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/duqc8Qil07","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/PS5only/status/1263442386249793539/photo/1","type":"photo","sizes":{"thumb":{"w":150,"h":150,"resize":"crop"},"small":{"w":680,"h":414,"resize":"fit"},"large":{"w":868,"h":529,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"w":868,"h":529,"resize":"fit"}}}]},"extended_entities":{"media":[{"id":1263442383062081500,"id_str":"1263442383062081536","indices":[270,293],"media_url":"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYimJ0SWoAA3_Jo.jpg","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYimJ0SWoAA3_Jo.jpg","url":"https://t.co/duqc8Qil07","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/duqc8Qil07","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/PS5only/status/1263442386249793539/photo/1","type":"photo","sizes":{"thumb":{"w":150,"h":150,"resize":"crop"},"small":{"w":680,"h":414,"resize":"fit"},"large":{"w":868,"h":529,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"w":868,"h":529,"resize":"fit"}}}]},"source":"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for iPhone</a>","in_reply_to_status_id":null,"in_reply_to_status_id_str":null,"in_reply_to_user_id":null,"in_reply_to_user_id_str":null,"in_reply_to_screen_name":null,"user":{"id":2188714462,"id_str":"2188714462","name":"PS5 Only","screen_name":"PS5only","location":"London, United Kingdom","description":"PS5 Only.

Health professionals should check this page and other respected websites for the latest information.\n\nWhat do we know about how COVID-19 is spread?\n\nThe most current evidence shows the virus transmits easily between people, most often through droplets generated by coughs and sneezes. Part of the idea of social distancing is that droplets can generally carry for only 5 to 6 feet. If you‚Äôre farther than that, your chances of getting the virus are generally lower.\n\nCOVID-19 may also be spread by people who are not showing symptoms (i.e., ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù). According to the CDC, 35% of all people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. However, those individuals are still as infectious as people with symptoms.¬†\n\nThe disease might be transmitted when people touch a contaminated surface or object and then touch their face, nose or mouth or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Current data and information also suggest that the risk of COVID-19 spreading from pets to people is low as well.\n\nNo matter the risk of transmission, rigorous hand hygiene and optimal cleaning practices at home and in public settings helps guard against the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nCan COVID-19 be spread by asymptomatic exposure?\n\nBased on the evidence from China, asymptomatic transmission may occur and has contributed to a limited amount of transmission of COVID-19 infections. People can shed the virus before they have symptoms, but this is generally less than individuals with symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ‚Äúthe potential for pre-symptomatic transmission underscores the importance of social distancing, including the avoidance of congregate settings, to reduce COVID-19 spread.‚Äù\n\nWhat are the signs of a COVID-19 patient surge that we should be watching for?\n\nWe continue to watch daily the rate of new infections, and the number of patients in the hospital (at UC Davis Medical Center and other regional medical centers), for signs of increase that could be an early warning for a potential patient surge. The state and county health departments are also keeping track of COVID-19 cases and watching for signs of a potential surge in COVID-19 patients. Working with other hospitals and our local public health departments, and with our own in-house testing capabilities, we should be able to quickly recognize the kind of increasing trend lines that would be early indicators of a possible surge in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.\n\nHow worried should healthy people be about becoming infected with COVID-19?\n\nMost healthy people who become infected with COVID-19 have no symptoms or have mild symptoms. However, there have been healthy people who have progressed to severe disease. We must be vigilant regardless of age and underlying illness. People who have underlying illness and who are older are at higher risk for getting severe disease, but they‚Äôre not the only ones at risk.\n\nWhat health care protocols are appropriate to help prevent the spread of COVID-19?\n\nContact droplet is the predominant route of COVID-19 transmission. Using appropriate contact droplet precautions, and in the circumstance where the patient can be masked, you increase the potential protection. If aerosolization is expected, then you should upgrade to N95 or PAPR-level protection. Since surfaces are lower risk but not zero risk of virus transmission, good hand hygiene, as well as keeping hands away from your face and appropriate housekeeping within the health care facility are still the best ways to protect against COVID-19 transmission.\n\nShould I wear a mask and maintain 6 feet of distance to help protect against COVID-19?\n\nIn every location, all employees need to either maintain at least 6 feet of distance from other people at all times, or wear a mask. In clinical areas where 6 feet of space between people cannot be maintained, clinical masks (ear loop/procedure masks) need to be worn. In non-clinical areas, employees should stay 6 feet apart at all times, or there should be a barrier in place (example: cubicle walls), or a face covering needs to be worn. In non-clinical areas, these masks can be cloth or homemade (with no logos).\n\nThis is in alignment with the Governor‚Äôs direction on April 14 to ensure our actions are aligned to achieve the following:\n\nEnsure our ability to care for the sick within our hospitals;\nPrevent infection in people who are at high risk for severe disease;\nBuild the capacity to protect the health and well-being of the public; and\nReduce social, emotional and economic disruptions\nWhich procedures are at highest risk for releasing airborne particulates of COVID-19?\n\nProcedures that release upper and lower respiratory tract specimens into the air are at higher risk for releasing airborne particulates by aerosolization. These procedures include intubation, BiPAP, high-flow nasal cannula, nebulizing medications, CPR and resuscitation and bronchoscopy. During these aerosol-generating procedures, providers should wear PAPR or an N95 mask as well as eye protection, a gown, and gloves. If available, it is preferred that the procedure be conducted in an airborne isolation room or private room, and personnel should be limited.\n\nWhat are the isolation and PPE recommendations when no aerosol-generating procedures are being performed?\n\nFor patients where no aerosol-generating procedures are expected, use contact and droplet precautions. Providers should use a surgical mask, eye protection (e.g. face shield), gown, and gloves.\n\nIf I've tested positive for COVID-19, what's the process for returning to work?\n\nBased on updated guidance from the CDC (April 30), the Calif. Dept. of Public Health (May 7), and Sacramento County‚Äôs Dept. of Public Health (May 9), there is now updated criteria for healthcare providers (HCP) returning to work.\n\nData no longer supports a test-based strategy to determine when staff can return to work. Instead, the criteria have shifted to a symptom-based strategy for those who test positive and are symptomatic, and a time-based strategy for those who test positive but are asymptomatic. In addition, the time-based strategy for returning to work has been expanded from 7 days to 10 days, which is supported by the latest scientific information.\n\nFor the symptomatic HCP with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, use the symptom-based strategy and do not return to work until:\n\nAt least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery, defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and‚Ä¶\nAt least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared\n\nFor the HCP who is asymptomatic with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and who has not had any symptoms, use the time-based strategy and do not return to work until:\n\n10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test, assuming HCP has not subsequently developed symptoms since their positive test. If they develop symptoms, then the symptom-based or test-based strategy should be used.\n\nVisit the CDC website for additional return-to-work information.\n\nMore from UC Davis Health: Information for community providers\nAdditional Coronavirus Resources\nCalifornia Department of Public Health: COVID-19\nCenters for Disease Control: Coronavirus (COVID-2019)\nWorld Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic\nJohns Hopkins real-time dashboard for COVID-2019 cases\nTo request an urgent referral:\n\nCall our Physician Referral Center at\n800-4-UCDAVIS (800-482-3284), option #3.\n\nCoronavirus News from UC Davis Health\n\nMore news¬†¬ª\n\nTweets from UC Davis Health\n\nTweets by UCDavisHealth\n\nQuick Links\nMyUCDavisHealth (formerly MyChart)\nMap & Directions\nClinical Trials\nPhysician Referral Center\nPatient Financial Assistance\nUC Davis Primary Care\nUC Davis Health\nUC Davis\nCommitment to Quality & Safety\nCommitment\nQuality & Patient Safety\nRecognition\nPrivacy Practices\nConnect with Us\n\nStay connected with what‚Äôs happening at UC¬†Davis Medical Center and UC¬†Davis Health.\n\n      \n\n¬†\n\nBack to top\n\nUC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER\n\n2315 Stockton Blvd.¬†¬†|¬† Sacramento, CA 95817 ¬†|¬† 24-hour Hospital Operator: 916-734-2011\n¬©¬†2020¬†UC Regents.

country, issued a statement that ‚Äúit would block access to all domestic and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO websites.‚Äù\n\nAs per the news, China aims to clamp down on ‚Äúall cryptocurrency trading with a ban on foreign exchanges.‚Äù\n\nChina has recently been¬†issuing regular advisories and taking steps to deter the use of cryptocurrency in the country. The recent development can completely eliminate cryptocurrency trading and mining activities in the world‚Äôs most populous nation.\n\nChinese regulatory authorities had imposed a ban on¬†initial coin offerings (ICO), a cryptocurrency-based fundraising process, and termed it illegal in China in¬†September 2017. That ban triggered an instant 6% decline in bitcoin prices. Following the ban, the¬†Shanghai-based BTCC bitcoin exchange was forced to close its Chinese trading operations.

However, despite the ICO ban and momentary decline, cryptocurrency trading continued in China, as many participants switched to foreign exchanges, like those based in Hong Kong and Japan, to deal in virtual currencies. (See more:¬†China's Cryptocurrencies Have Gone Underground.)\n\nIn a series of measures, the PBOC is tightening regulations on domestic dealers engaged in foreign cryptocurrency transactions and ICOs. It has also forbidden China-based financial institutions from any dealing and funding in cryptocurrency linked activities.\n\nChinese Government Concerned About Fraud\n\nThe recent announcement effectively puts a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies¬†in China, and comes as the¬†People's Bank of China¬†is seeing increasing turnover in overseas transactions leading to regulatory compliance evasion.

China is home to a large number¬†of bitcoin mining farms as a lot of regions offer cheap subsidized electricity, making mining a profitable venture.\n\nMany agree that the ban by Chinese authorities will have a negative impact on the overall digital currency¬†market. Stricter regulations by the PBOC will \"definitely weigh on the cryptocurrency universe,\" said Wayne Cao, who runs a company that recently offered 10 billion tokens in an ICO.\n\nIn January 2018, Bobby Lee, CEO and co-founder of BTCC¬†(which closed its China operations), expressed hope that ‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time before China lifts the crypto exchange ban.‚Äù During an¬†interview with CNBC, Lee said the¬†resilient¬†nature of cryptocurrencies¬†will enable them to¬†spring back following more regulations.\n\nQuestions remain on the effectiveness of the regulations because taming the decentralized, regulation-free blockchain-based virtual currency market¬†will remain a big¬†challenge for any real-world regulator.
