Donald Trump says America's coronavirus curve is flattening but a second wave is coming for rural communities

Cuthbert is the kind of place where social distancing was practiced well before it became a buzzword.

Tucked away in a quiet, empty corner of south-west Georgia, the town has one traffic light, two grocery stores and a dozen churches. There are zero skyscrapers or subway cars or international airports.

So, when Cuthbert's 3,000 residents first learned about coronavirus — visualised as maps with big red circles around America's urban centres — they thought to themselves, "surely that sort of thing could never happen here".

And in that way, Cuthbert's experience foreshadowed what's quickly becoming a pattern with the rest of rural America.

Coronavirus update: Follow all the latest news in our daily wrap.

The country's most vulnerable communities, lulled into a false sense of security, are getting slammed with America's second wave of the virus right as the rest of the nation sees an overall flattening curve and pushes to move on.

Cuthbert had the highest death rate per-capita in the US

At the time of writing, Cuthbert and the surrounding Randolph County (total population: 6,700) reported 169 confirmed cases and 21 deaths.

That may seem like a drop in the bucket in a country with 84,000 deaths and counting.

But the speed with which the virus took over the town meant that for a few days in April, Randolph County had the highest per capita death rate in America.

County coroner Rusty Chapman said he'd never seen anything like it during his 12 years on the job.

"I was born and raised in this community … Everybody knows everybody. You meet each other on the road, you meet each other at the grocery store, you meet each other at the gas station.

"If I didn't know the actual victims themselves, I knew the family members who'd be there grieving," he said.

He reported the first COVID-19 death on March 27: a woman found by her husband after a 10-day health battle the local doctors had first diagnosed as severe allergies.

Her test results didn't come back positive until four days after her death. Like everywhere else in America, Cuthbert's early days of testing could take up to 14 days to produce results.

"By the time we had our first death, it had been here for two weeks. It was basically a silent enemy for two weeks before it started killing people," Mr Chapman said.

The next day was another death — a COVID-19 victim who'd never been taken to hospital. The next day brought another.

Mr Chapman said it was five or six days of daily COVID-19 deaths before the community realised it wasn't going to be just a few isolated cases.

It was around that time they learned it had hit the nursing home.

Rural healthcare is fragile even in the best of times

One reason that rural communities like Cuthbert are so vulnerable to coronavirus is that their populations tend to be older.

Roughly 18 per cent of rural residents are 65 or older, compared with 13 per cent in cities, a proportion that's only widening over time.

Less than 2 per cent of those older rural residents live in an aged care facility because in most remote American areas, such facilities don't exist.

Cuthbert considered itself lucky to have the Jo-Anne Burgin Nursing Home, which operates under a state-managed agreement with a larger public health system.

But that luck became a liability when the 80-bed facility held more than 55 confirmed cases and 11 COVID-19 deaths — an outbreak so bad that the National Guard was called in to test all residents and sanitise the space.

The nursing home is connected with the small hospital in Cuthbert, which saw its 25 beds fill up practically overnight.

At one point, more than 30 medical staff, who often rotate between other facilities in the area, had tested positive for the virus and had to stay home.

With all the medical urgency, the little town of Cuthbert suddenly resembled New York in a way it never had before.

Except when New York ran out of hospital space, the solution was to drive patients across the city to the next hospital or the federally managed field clinic.

For Cuthbert — a town with one ambulance — it meant sending nearly all patients up to three hours away to bigger communities with higher capacity to handle an outbreak. It involved helicopters.

"We send a lot of life flights. Maybe two or three a day," said Kenneth Burns, the local Fire Chief, who also serves as the county's Emergency Management Coordinator.

"It's a priority basis sort of thing. We often have to call around and figure out who can take them."

Outsourcing patients is more common than you'd think

Roughly 18 million Americans live in counties that have hospitals but no intensive care units, which contain specialised equipment such as ventilators.

Coronavirus questions answered

Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast.

Eleven million Americans live in counties with no hospitals at all — a number that is increasing as nearly a dozen rural hospitals close down every year.

Even if they have access to a hospital, rural Americans can't always afford it.

Nearly 12 per cent of rural Americans lack health insurance, and those numbers don't reflect the latest recent record-setting unemployment rate, which is estimated to have cost 27 million Americans their employer-based insurance.

Even with insurance, the average hospital stays costs more than $1,550 and 13 per cent of rural Americans live below the poverty line.

In Cuthbert, the rate is 28 per cent.

So you can see why the panic started to set in.

The rumours spread just as fast as the virus

The Coroner said the calls started pouring in around the fifth day.

"With Facebook and text messaging and word of mouth, the word got out pretty quickly," Mr Chapman said.

"We would get rumours that this person died of COVID-19, that person died of COVID-19 … I got the funeral homes to start notifying me any time they went and picked up a body from a hospital, whether they were COVID-19 deaths or not."

When a pandemic hits a small town, rumours begin to swirl about who brought the infection from the outside world.(ABC News: Christopher Vega)

Everyone had a theory on where it came from, but the consensus is that it had to be Albany.

Because Cuthbert is the biggest town in an area of 1,120 square kilometres, its residents drive an hour to Albany (population 75,000) to shop at Walmart or see a movie or even just to work.

One resident said Cuthbert's first case probably came from one of two large funerals. Another pegged it on a toilet paper factory, which refused to slow production in the face of panic-buying demand.

Sure enough, Albany's outbreak timed perfectly with Cuthbert's and nearly matched it in per-capita size. It was Albany that got all the national headlines, visits from Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and praise for its handling of the virus.

For an insular community like Cuthbert, it's easy to point to the outside as the source of the virus.

The tone gets a bit more cautious when it comes to how it spread among Cuthbert's ranks.

No one wants to blame their neighbours in a time that still feels so emotionally raw, but they allude to an aspect of rural life that may have amplified it: people kept gathering.

Some didn't realise the danger until it was too late

Because the community itself can feel isolated, the interactions that happen between residents in Cuthbert take on a little more weight.

As social distancing becomes crucial in Cuthbert, church services have been streamed online for the faithful.(ABC News: Christopher Vega)

Church on Sunday is a must. Family suppers are important. The comings and goings of life are celebrated and mourned with company.

The community leaders advised residents about the national guidelines in March and followed Governor Kemp's statewide stay-at-home order when it came on April 2, a week after they had their first case.

All non-essential businesses — of which there are few — were asked to close. Restaurants moved to curb-side pick-up, the grocery stores limited their capacity and church services were streamed on Facebook.

The pandemic has only added to the sense of isolation for many residents in this tiny Georgian town.(ABC News: Christopher Vega)

But Fire Chief Burns said that in those first few days, he still saw "a lot of big gatherings".

He felt that many residents believed they would not be affected by the outbreak

"Another problem with all this is that if somebody gets it, they're kind of being told, 'don't tell nobody. Don't let your family know'."

He described one family that didn't tell the funeral home the death was caused by COVID-19. It was early on in the outbreak, and the family was worried they might lose their jobs if anyone found out.

The funeral proceeded and the wake, held at the family's home, drew a crowd.

"I think after the 20-plus funerals, they all get it now. There's a little more on the 'wake up' side," Mr Burns said.

Once it hit home, the community managed to control the virus

Cuthbert didn't see it coming but, once the deaths started mounting, the community came together.

The number of cases for Cuthbert and the surrounding county has nearly flatlined since the end of April. The last death was recorded over two weeks ago.

Mayor Steve Whatley said it feels like they've "flattened the curve and turned a corner."

But around that corner is economic recovery, which is certain to be another obstacle.

Georgia, one of the last states to issue stay-at-home orders, was among the first states to partially lift them, advising places like salons and tattoo parlours it was safe to resume business on April 24.

That measure was met with criticism from scientists who warned it could only lead to more cases, but for Cuthbert, it felt like a much-needed lifeline.

"I'm cautiously optimistic," Mr Whatley said.

"We have so much more poverty … I was afraid that it was going to have a devastating impact if we didn't begin to reach some sense of normal. We're still a long way from that."

The devastating economic impact is a thing Mr Whatley knows well. The Mayor runs an oil distribution business and says the demand for petrol is down 50 per cent.

In its ability to see a flattening curve and look towards economic recovery, the community feels a bit like an outlier these days.

How fast is coronavirus growing around the world?
This chart uses a logarithmic scale to highlight coronavirus growth rates. Read our explainer to understand what that means — and how COVID-19 cases are spreading around the world.

Well over two-thirds of rural counties have been impacted by the virus but most didn't see their first cases until April. The numbers in these communities are only just starting to rise.

America's low-density regions sit in a precarious place in the country's overall outlook. The collective numbers, skewed by burgeoning recoveries in places like New York, show glimmers of stability.

Cuthbert offers a warning for those who might be looking at the big map and missing the small places.

The deaths of even 21 individuals are enough to leave lasting scars.
